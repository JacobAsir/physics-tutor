Have\\nyou ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another\\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\\nsky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric\\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the\\nstudy of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges .\\n1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE\\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\\nelektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\\nChapter One\\nELECTRIC CHARGES\\nAND FIELDS'),\n",

Take them near a\\nTV screen or computer monitor. You will\\nsee that the strips get attracted to the\\nscreen. In fact they remain stuck to the\\nscreen for a while.\\nIt was observed that if two glass rods\\nrubbed with wool or silk cloth are\\nbrought close to each other, they repel\\neach other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands\\nof wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with\\nwhich the rods were rubbed, also repel\\neach other. However, the glass rod and\\nwool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s\\nfur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other\\nhand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk\\nor wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.\\nIf a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls\\n(now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon\\nthread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled\\nby the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a\\nglass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a\\npith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with\\nplastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f )].\\nThese seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts\\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\\nan entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\\nan electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested\\nthat there are two kinds of electrification and we find  that (i) like charges\\nrepel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The experiments also\\ndemonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith\\nballs on  contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged\\nby  contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is\\ncalled the polarity of charge.\\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\\nno longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light\\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\\nbodies are brought in contact.

Therefore the charges were named\\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\\nWe know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of\\nthe same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the\\nphilosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention,\\nthe charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic\\nrod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it\\nis said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be\\nneutral.\\nUNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\\nIn olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity\\ndealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism\\ndescribed interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish\\nscientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current\\nthrough a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation\\nby saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets\\ngenerate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell\\nand the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the\\ninterdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism. Most of the\\nphenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually\\nevery force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the\\nmatter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living\\norganisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the\\nfundamental forces of nature.\\nMaxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism\\nas Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued\\nthat light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely\\nelectric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately\\nrelated to that of electricity and magnetism.\\nThe science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological\\ncivilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety\\nof the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science.\\nAlthough charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the\\nframe of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You\\nknow that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance\\nbetween the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as\\nthe square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter\\nthat electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force\\nby several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).\\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\\nthe amount of charge.'),\n",

Cut\\nout a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at\\none end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle\\nthat can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the\\nopening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork\\nsufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the\\nrod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on\\nthe lower side and ball end projecting above the cork.\\nFold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in\\nlength) in the middle and attach it to the flattened\\nend of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves\\nof your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with\\nabout 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork.\\nA paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance\\nto measure the separation of leaves. The separation\\nis a rough measure of the amount of charge on the\\nelectroscope.\\nTo understand how the electroscope works, use\\nthe white paper strips we used for seeing the\\nattraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half\\nso that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and\\niron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown\\nin Fig. 1.3. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold.\\nYou would notice that the two halves move apart.\\nThis shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold\\nit into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each\\nother. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the\\ncurtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is\\ntransferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the\\nhalves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The\\ndivergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let\\nus first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.\\nYou know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules.\\nAlthough normally the materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain\\ncharges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the\\nmolecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive\\nforce of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically\\nelectrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles.\\nThus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each\\nand every field associated with our life. It is therefore  essential that we\\nlearn more about such a force.\\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\\nFIGURE 1.2 Electroscopes: (a) The gold leaf\\nelectroscope, (b) Schematics of a simple\\nelectroscope.\\nFIGURE 1.3 Paper strip\\nexperiment.'),\n",

When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\\nmaterial body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material\\nbody can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when\\na body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why\\nwe have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing\\nthe bodies.\\n1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\\nA metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of\\nbeing charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is\\nrubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.\\nSuppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and\\nthe other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the\\npith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated\\nwith a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take\\nplace from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge\\nnot take place from the rod to the ball?\\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them,\\nothers do not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily\\nare called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are\\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators. Most  substances\\nfall into one of the two classes stated above*.\\nWhen some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets\\ndistributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some\\ncharge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn\\nwhy this happens in the next chapter.\\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\\nlike spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the\\nground as both are conductors of electricity.\\n  When we bring a charged body  in contact with the earth,  all the\\nexcess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current\\nto pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our\\nbody). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called\\ngrounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical\\ncircuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth\\nand thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are  used in buildings\\nfor the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.  The electric wiring in\\nour houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry\\n* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the\\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\\ninsulators.'),\n",

Metallic bodies of the electric\\nappliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the\\nearth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body,\\nthe charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without\\ncausing any injury to the humans; this  would have otherwise been\\nunavoidable since  the human body is a  conductor of electricity.\\n1.4  CHARGING BY INDUCTION\\nWhen we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the\\nnegative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also\\ngets charged. Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled\\nby the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely\\ncharged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is  a  question\\nwe have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be\\nhappening by performing the following experiment.\\n(i) Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands,\\nin contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a).\\n(ii) Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking\\ncare that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres\\nare attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge\\non the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in\\nthe metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the\\nsurfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an\\nexcess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an\\nexcess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres\\nhave accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge\\nstarts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled\\nby these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of\\nforce of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the\\naccumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation.\\nThe process is called induction of charge  and happens almost\\ninstantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown,\\ntill the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the\\ncharges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to\\ntheir original neutral state.\\n(iii) Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still\\nheld near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found\\nto be oppositely charged and attract each other.\\n(iv) Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as\\nshown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The\\ncharges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in\\nFig. 1.4(e).\\nIn this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely\\ncharged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod\\ndoes not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by\\ncontact.\\nWhen electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect\\ntakes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of\\nthe objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object.\\nFIGURE 1.4 Charging\\nby induction.'),\n",

However,\\nthe magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges\\nand in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion.\\nAs a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are\\npulled towards the rods.\\nExample 1.1 How can you charge a metal sphere positively without\\ntouching it?\\nSolution Figure 1.5(a) shows an uncharged metallic sphere on an\\ninsulating metal stand.

The near end becomes\\npositively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge\\ndistribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the\\nmetal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting\\nwire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges\\nat the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of\\nthe negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c).

Here,  we shall now\\ndescribe some other properties of the electric charge.\\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the\\ndistances between them, we treat them as point charges . All the\\ncharge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point\\nin space.\\n1.5.1  Additivity of charges\\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall\\nfollow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can\\nbe done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q1 and q2,\\nthe total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically\\nq1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like\\nthe mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, …, q n, then\\nthe total charge of the system is q1 + q 2 + q 3 + … + q n .  Charge has\\nmagnitude but no direction, similar to the mass. However, there is one\\ndifference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive\\nwhereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to\\nbe used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the\\ntotal charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5,\\nin some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the\\nsame unit.\\n1.5.2  Charge is conserved\\nWe have already  hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by\\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.\\nWithin an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved.\\nConservation of charge has been established experimentally.\\nIt is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed\\nin a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have\\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\\nthe creation.\\n1.5.3  Quantisation of charge\\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\\ngiven by\\nq = ne'),\n",

This basic unit of charge is\\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.\\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\\nMillikan in 1912.\\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\\nsubsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge\\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2\\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\\nbasic unit of charge is\\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\\nThus, there are about 6 × 10 18 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\\nand hence we use smaller units 1 μC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe,\\nall the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a\\nbody contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount of charge\\non the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2 are integers,\\ntheir difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always\\nan integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps\\nof e.\\nThe step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few μC. At this scale the fact that charge of\\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. The grainy\\nnature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge\\ndistribution.\\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\\nof magnitude, say 1 μC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\\npractical consequence and can be ignored. At the microscopic level, where\\nthe charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds of e, i.e.,'),\n",

It is the scale involved that is very important.\\nExample 1.2  If 10 9 electrons move out of a body to another body\\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\\non the other body?\\nSolution In one second 10 9 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10 –10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\\nunit for many practical purposes.\\nIt is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of\\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material.\\nA cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 10 24\\nelectrons.\\nExample 1.3 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\\ncup of water?\\nSolution  Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\\n(= 6.02 × 10 23 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 10 23.\\nEach molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C.\\n1.6  COULOMB’S LAW\\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the\\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\\nacted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges\\nq1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the\\nforce (F) between them is given by\\n21\\n2\\nqqFk\\nr\\n= (1.1)\\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?

When the separation between two spheres is much\\nlarger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres\\nmay be regarded as point charges. However, the charges\\non the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then\\ncould he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb\\nthought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge\\non a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread\\nover the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each\\nsphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get\\ncharges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a\\nfixed pair of charges and measured the force for different\\nseparations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping\\nthe distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for\\ndifferent pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb\\narrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,\\nwas initially experimentally arrived at  in the manner\\ndescribed above. While the original experiments\\nestablished it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been\\nestablished down to subatomic level  (r ~ 10–10 m).\\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the\\nexplicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other\\nway round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to\\nfurnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation,\\nEq. (1.1), k is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive\\nvalue of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit\\nof charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 109.\\nThe unit of charge that results from this choice is called\\na coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4.\\nPutting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for\\nq1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\\nF = 9 × 109 N\\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a\\ndistance of 1 m from another charge of the same\\nmagnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of\\nrepulsion of magnitude 9 × 10 9 N. One coulomb is\\nevidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in\\nelectrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 μC.\\nThe constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as\\nk = 1/4πε0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as\\n0\\n12\\n2\\n1\\n4\\nqqF rε= π (1.2)\\nε0 is called the permittivity of free space . The value of ε0 in SI units is\\n0ε = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2\\n* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\\ntwo charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.\\nCharles Augustin de\\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\\nCoulomb, a French\\nphysicist, began his career\\nas a military engineer in\\nthe West Indies.

It follows straight from the fact\\nthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof\\nis left to you as an exercise.\\n1.8  ELECTRIC FIELD\\nLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we\\nplace another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q\\nwill exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If\\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\\nnothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act\\nwhen we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the\\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\\nWhen another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on\\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q  at a\\npoint r is given as\\n( ) 22\\n00\\n11 ˆˆ\\n44\\nQQ\\nrrεε== ππEr r r (1.6)\\nwhere ˆ =r  r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\\nvector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the\\nforce F exerted by a charge Q on a charge q, as\\n2\\n0\\n1 ˆ\\n4\\nQq\\nrε= πFr (1.7)\\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it\\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.\\nSome important remarks may be made here:\\n(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\\nelectric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined\\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\\n* An alternate unit V/m will be introduced in the next chapter.\\nFIGURE 1.11 Electric\\nfield (a) due to a\\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\\ncharge –Q.'),\n",

The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\\ncalled a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\\nsource charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q\\nmust remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought\\nat any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\\n0\\nlim\\nq q→\\n⎛⎞= ⎜⎟⎝⎠\\nFE (1.9)\\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.15), the charges on the sheet are held to\\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\\ninside the sheet.\\n(ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally\\nin terms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\\nthe space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over\\nthe space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\\n(iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\\nnegative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.\\n(iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude\\nof its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to\\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.\\n1.8.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\\nConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., qn with  position vectors r1,\\nr2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\\npositions of charges q1, q2, ..., qn. We can use Coulomb’s law and the\\nsuperposition principle to determine this field at a point P denoted by\\nposition vector r.'),\n",

After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,\\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot\\nFIGURE 1.12 Electric field at a\\npoint due to a system of charges is\\nthe vector sum of the electric fields\\nat the point due to individual\\ncharges.'),\n",

There will be some time delay between the effect\\n(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the\\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q 1\\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on briefly and switched off, leaves\\nbehind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy.

In this figure, each\\narrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the force acting on a\\nunit positive charge, placed at the tail of that arrow.\\nConnect the arrows pointing in one direction and the\\nresulting figure represents a field line. We thus get many\\nfield lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge.\\nHave we lost the information about the strength or\\nmagnitude of the field now, because it was contained in\\nthe length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\\nthe charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge,\\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\\nresulting in well-separated lines.\\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.\\nFIGURE 1.15 Field of a point charge.\\n EXAMPLE 1.9'),\n",

So if one wishes\\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry information\\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\\nwhere it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines. We\\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\\narea with the solid angle, a generalization of angle to three dimensions.\\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\\ntransverse line element Δl be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then\\nthe angle subtended by Δl  at O can be approximated as Δθ = Δl/r.\\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small\\nperpendicular plane area ΔS, at a distance r, can be written as\\nΔΩ = ΔS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.16, for two points P1 and P2 at distances\\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\\nΔΩ is 2\\n1r ΔΩ at P1 and an element of area 2\\n2r ΔΩ at P2, respectively. The\\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/( 2\\n1r ΔΩ) at\\nP1 andn/( 2\\n2r ΔΩ) at P2, respectively. Since n and ΔΩ are common, the\\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/r2 dependence.\\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\\nintuitive non- mathematical way of visualizing electric fields around\\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is\\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\\nappropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have\\nadopted in this book.\\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,\\nFIGURE 1.16  Dependence of\\nelectric field strength on the\\ndistance and its relation to the\\nnumber of field lines.\\n* Solid angle is a measure of a cone.

The\\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\\nflowing across the plane.

Now\\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle θ.\\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\\narea element will be smaller. The projection of\\nthe area element normal to E is ΔS cosθ. Thus,\\nthe number of field lines crossing ΔS is\\nproportional to E ΔS cosθ. When θ = 90°, field\\nlines will be parallel to ΔS and will not cross it\\nat all (Fig. 1.18).\\nThe orientation of area element and not\\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\\norientation. This shows that an area element\\nshould be treated as a vector. It has a\\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\\nHow to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine\\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\\nwith it, as explained before.\\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\\nto be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used\\nin Fig. 1.19. Thus, the area element vector ΔS at a point on a closed\\nsurface equals ΔS ˆn  where ΔS is the magnitude of the area element and\\nˆn  is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Δφ through\\nan area element ΔS is defined by\\nΔφ = E.ΔS = E ΔS  cosθ (1.11)\\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\\nthe area element. The angle θ here is the angle between E and ΔS. For a\\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, θ is the angle between\\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\\nthe expression E ΔS cosθ  in two ways:  E ( ΔS cosθ ) i.e., E times the\\nFIGURE 1.18 Dependence of flux on the\\ninclination θ between E and ˆn .\\nFIGURE 1.19\\nConvention for\\ndefining normal\\nˆn  and ΔS. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to EΔS.

The line connecting the two charges defines\\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to\\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is\\ncalled the centre of the dipole.\\nThe total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than\\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole ( r >> 2a), the fields\\ndue to q and – q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r2 (the dependence\\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\\n1.11.1  The field of an electric dipole\\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space\\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.\\nThe results are simple for the following two cases: (i) when the point is on\\nthe dipole axis, and (ii) when it is in the equatorial plane of the dipole,\\ni.e.,  on a plane perpendicular to the dipole axis through its centre.

(By permanent dipole, we\\nmean that p exists  irrespective of E; it has not been induced by E.)\\nThere is a force qE on q and a force –qE on –q. The net force on\\nthe dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are\\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of\\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular\\ndistance between the two antiparallel forces).\\nMagnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinθ\\n       = 2 q a E sinθ\\nIts direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it.\\nThe magnitude of p × E is also p E sinθ and its direction\\nis normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,\\nτ  = p × E (1.22)\\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\\nFigure 1.23 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\\nwith respect to E.\\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\\npaper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through\\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\\nthe attractive force?

One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element ΔS (Fig. 1.24)\\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\\nspecify the charge ΔQ on that element. We then define a surface charge\\ndensity σ at the area element by\\nQ\\nSσ Δ= Δ (1.23)\\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\\na continuous function σ, called the surface charge density. The surface\\ncharge density σ  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. σ  represents\\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element ΔS which,\\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\\nunits for σ are C/m2.\\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density λ of a wire is defined by\\nQ\\nlλ Δ= Δ (1.24)\\nwhere Δl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\\nhowever, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents,\\nand ΔQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for λ are\\nC/m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density)\\nis defined in a similar manner:\\nQ\\nVρ Δ= Δ (1.25)\\nwhere ΔQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\\nelement ΔV that includes a large number of microscopic charged\\nconstituents. The units for ρ are C/m3.\\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to\\nFIGURE 1.24\\nDefinition of linear,\\nsurface and volume\\ncharge densities.\\nIn each case, the\\nelement ( Δl, ΔS, ΔV)\\nchosen is small on\\nthe macroscopic\\nscale but contains\\na very large number\\nof microscopic\\nconstituents.\\n* At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.'),\n",

In a strict\\nmathematical method, we should let ΔV→0 and the sum then becomes\\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\\ndiscrete and part continuous.\\n1.14  GAUSS’S LAW\\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\\ntotal flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q\\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\\nFig. 1.25.\\nThe flux through an area element ΔS is\\n2\\n0\\nˆ\\n4\\nq\\nrφ εΔ= Δ = Δ πES r Sii (1.28)\\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\\ncharge q. The unit vector ˆr is along the radius vector from the centre to\\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element ΔS and ˆr  have\\nthe same direction. Therefore,\\n2\\n04\\nq Srφ εΔ= Δ π (1.29)\\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1.\\nThe total flux through the sphere is obtained by adding up flux\\nthrough all the different area elements:\\nFIGURE 1.25 Flux\\nthrough a sphere\\nenclosing a point\\ncharge q at its centre.\"),\n",

We can see that explicitly in\\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.26.\\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total\\nflux φ  through the surface is  φ = φ1 + φ2 + φ3, where φ1 and φ2 represent\\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\\ncylinder and φ3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, φ3 = 0. Further, the outward\\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\\nTherefore,\\nφ1 = –E S1,     φ2 = +E S2\\nS1 = S2 = S\\nwhere S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\\nus note some important points regarding this law:\\n(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\\nor size.\\n(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\\nanywhere inside the surface.\\n(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\\noutside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,\\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\\nFIGURE 1.26  Calculation of the\\nflux of uniform electric field\\nthrough the surface of a cylinder.'),\n",

The wire\\nis obviously an axis of symmetry. Suppose we\\ntake the radial vector from O to P and rotate it\\naround the wire. The points P, P ′, P ′′ so\\nobtained are completely equivalent with\\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\\nevery point must be radial (outward if λ > 0,\\ninward if λ < 0). This is clear from Fig. 1.29.\\nConsider a pair of line elements P1 and P2\\nof the wire, as shown. The electric fields\\nproduced by the two elements of the pair when\\nsummed give a resultant electric field which\\nis radial (the components normal to the radial\\nvector cancel). This is true for any such pair\\nand hence the total field at any point P is\\nradial. Finally, since the wire is infinite,\\nelectric field does not depend on the position\\nof P along the length of the wire. In short, the\\nelectric field is everywhere radial in the plane\\ncutting the wire normally, and its magnitude\\ndepends only on the radial distance r.\\nTo calculate the field, imagine a cylindrical\\nGaussian surface, as shown in the Fig. 1.29(b).\\nSince the field is everywhere radial, flux\\nthrough the two ends of the cylindrical\\nGaussian surface is zero.

It can be\\nnegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit\\nvector ˆa if A > 0 and opposite to ˆa  if A < 0. When we want to restrict to\\nnon-negative values, we use the symbol A and call it the modulus of A.\\nThus, 0≥A .\\nAlso note that though only  the charge enclosed by the surface (λl)\\nwas included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire\\nwire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial.\\nWithout this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved\\npart of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq.

The\\nfield at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\\nalong the radius vector).\\n(i) Field outside the shell:  Consider a point P outside the\\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\\nO, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent\\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\\nΔS at every point are parallel and the flux through each\\nelement is E ΔS. Summing over all ΔS, the flux through the\\nGaussian surface is E × 4 π r2. The charge enclosed is\\nσ × 4 π R2.

Consideration of these\\nsymmetries helps one arrive at results much faster than otherwise by a straightforward\\ncalculation. Consider, for example an infinite uniform sheet of charge (surface charge\\ndensity σ) along the y-z plane. This system is unchanged if (a) translated parallel to the\\ny-z plane in any direction, (b) rotated about the x-axis through any angle. As the system\\nis unchanged under such symmetry operation, so must its properties be. In particular,\\nin this example, the electric field E must be unchanged.\\nTranslation symmetry along the y-axis shows that the electric field must be the same\\nat a point (0, y1, 0) as at (0, y2, 0). Similarly translational symmetry along the z-axis\\nshows that the electric field at two point (0, 0, z1) and (0, 0, z2) must be the same. By\\nusing rotation symmetry around the x-axis, we can conclude that E must be\\nperpendicular to the y-z plane, that is, it must be parallel to the x-direction.\\nTry to think of a symmetry now which will tell you that the magnitude of the electric\\nfield is a constant, independent of the x-coordinate. It thus turns out that the magnitude\\nof the electric field due to a uniformly charged infinite conducting sheet is the same at all\\npoints in space. The direction, however, is opposite of each other on either side of the\\nsheet.\\nCompare this with the effort needed to arrive at this result by a direct calculation\\nusing Coulomb’s law.'),\n",

Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\\nmolecules and bulk matter.\\n2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\\nthen negative.\\n3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators\\ndo not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes\\nboth positive and negative ions are mobile.\\n4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\\nand conservation.\\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body\\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,\\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored.\\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\\nof all individual charges in the system.\\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\\nfrom one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.\\n5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point\\ncharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely\\nproportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.\\nMathematically,\\nF21 = force on q2 due to  \\n12\\n12 1 2\\n21\\nˆk( q q )q r= r\\nwhere 21ˆr  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =  \\n0\\n1\\n4 επ\\nis the constant of proportionality.\\nIn SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb.

The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\\nweak.

You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges, are\\ncompactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You\\nwill learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the\\nstrong force which holds them together. The range of distance where\\nthis force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14 m. This is precisely\\nthe size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on\\ntop of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum\\nmechanics. This gives the atoms their structure as they exist in nature.\\n2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\\nCoulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\\nforce in nature.\\n3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\\napproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2.\\n4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\\nmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally\\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\\nelectric effects.\\n5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\\ncharge is a scalar.\\n6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\\ntrue for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under\\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\\nmotion.\\n7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.\\nConservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.\\nA quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).\\n8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.\\n9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or equated\\nwith the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one\\ncharge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other\\ncharges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces\\nwhich arise only when there are more than two charges.\\n10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\\nat the locations of the discrete charges.

When an external force does work in taking a body from a\\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\\nconservative forces.\\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges, like the gravitational\\nforce, is also a conservative force. This is not surprising, since both have\\ninverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the\\nproportionality constants – the masses in the gravitational law are\\nreplaced by charges in Coulomb’s law. Thus, like the potential energy of\\na mass in a gravitational field, we can define electrostatic potential energy\\nof a charge in an electrostatic field.\\nConsider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.\\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the\\norigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a\\npoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q.

For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\\nWRP =   \\nP\\nR\\ndext∫ Fr /G67\\n        =    \\nP\\nR\\ndE− ∫ Fr/G67  (2.1)\\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\\nas potential energy.\\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\\nR and P.\\nThus, potential energy difference\\nPR R PUU U W∆= − = (2.2)\\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –WRP .)\\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\\n(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field\\nof any arbitrary charge configuration.\\nTwo important comments may be made at this stage:\\n(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\\none point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a\\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence\\nof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the\\nCoulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.\\nFIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is\\nmoved from the point R to the\\npoint P against the repulsive\\nforce on it by the charge Q (> 0)\\nplaced at the origin.'),\n",

This is true in general: for any charge\\nconfiguration, equipotential surface through a point is normal to the\\nelectric field at that point. The proof of this statement is simple.\\nIf the field were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would\\nhave non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge\\nagainst the direction of the component of the field, work would have to\\nbe done. But this is in contradiction to the definition of an equipotential\\nsurface: there is no potential difference between any two points on the\\nsurface and no work is required to move a test charge on the surface.\\nThe electric field must, therefore, be normal to the equipotential surface\\nat every point.

In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.\\nWhat is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\\npotential V due to the external sources. We assume that the charge q\\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q\\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\\nThe external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\\ndone in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point P.'),\n",

We shall restrict our discussion\\nto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding\\nelectrostatics of conductors.\\n1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\\nconductor .\\n2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\\nsurface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every\\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\\n3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\\nthe static situation\\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\\nThis follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\\nv inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume\\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.\\n4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\\nits surface\\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That\\nis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on\\nthe surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,'),\n",

In contrast to conductors,\\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\\neffect, we need to look at the charge\\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\\nmolecular level.\\nThe molecules of a substance may be\\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\\nare oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2)\\nmolecules which, because of their\\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\\nare separated (even when there is no\\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\\npermanent dipole moment. An ionic\\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\\n(H2O) are examples of polar molecules.\\nFIGURE 2.20  Difference in behaviour\\nof a conductor and a dielectric\\nin an external electric field.\\nFIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar\\nand non-polar molecules.'),\n",

The displacement stops when\\nthe external force on the constituent\\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\\nthus develops an induced dipole moment.\\nThe dielectric is said to be polarised by\\nthe external field. We consider only the\\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\\nis proportional to the field strength.\\n(Substances for which this assumption\\nis true are called linear isotropic\\ndielectrics.) The induced dipole moments\\nof different molecules add up giving a net\\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\\npresence of the external field.\\nA dielectric with polar molecules also\\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\\nexternal field, but for a different reason.\\nIn the absence of any external field, the\\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\\nrandomly due to thermal agitation; so\\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align\\nwith the field. When summed over all the molecules, there is then a net\\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\\nto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole\\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\\neffect is more important for polar molecules.\\nThus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops\\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole\\nmoment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For\\nlinear isotropic dielectrics,\\neχ=PE (2.37)\\nwhere χ e is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the\\nelectric susceptibility of the dielectric medium.\\nIt is possible to relate χ e to the molecular properties of the substance,\\nbut we shall not pursue that here.\\nThe question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original\\nexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular\\ndielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its\\nfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric.

The volume element ∆ v  is\\nmacroscopically small but contains a very large number of\\nmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the\\nvolume element ∆ v has no net charge (though it has net\\ndipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one\\ndipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.\\nHowever, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the\\nelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen\\nin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain\\nunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at\\nthe left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced\\ncharges due to the external field.\\nThus the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged\\nsurfaces with induced surface charge densities, say σ p\\nand –σ p. Clearly, the field produced by these surface charges\\nopposes the external field. The total field in the dielectric\\nis, thereby, reduced from the case when no dielectric is\\npresent. We should note that the surface charge density\\n±σ p arises from bound (not free charges) in the dielectric.\\n2.11  CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE\\nA capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator\\n(Fig. 2.24). The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials\\nV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V1 – V2 between them. We shall\\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of\\nthe capacitor  is zero.\\nThe electric field in the region between the\\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,\\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point.\\n(This follows from the direct proportionality\\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.\\nConsequently,  V is also proportional to Q, and\\nthe ratio Q/V is a constant:\\nQC V= (2.38)\\nThe constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor. C is independent\\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the\\nFIGURE 2.23 A uniformly\\npolarised dielectric amounts\\nto induced surface charge\\ndensity, but no volume\\ncharge density.\\nFIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors\\nseparated by an insulator forms a capacitor.\\n'),\n",

[As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V –1. A capacitor\\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\\nvariable capacitance is shown as  .\\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\\nintervening medium.\\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\\nstrength; for air it is about 3 × 10 6 Vm–1. For a separation between\\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\\nstore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should\\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 µ F = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.\\n2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25). We first take the\\nintervening medium between the plates to be\\nvacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between\\nthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be\\nthe area of each plate and d the separation between\\nthem. The two plates have charges Q and –Q. Since\\nd is much smaller than the linear dimension of the\\nplates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric\\nfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface\\ncharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface\\ncharge density σ  = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface\\ncharge density –σ . Using Eq.

The\\nnatural tendency is for positive charge to\\nmove from higher to lower potential. Thus,\\nprovided we are somehow able to introduce\\nthe small charged sphere into the larger one,\\nwe can in this way keep piling up larger and\\nlarger amount of charge on the latter. The\\npotential (Eq. 2.78) at the outer sphere would\\nalso keep rising, at least until we reach the\\nbreakdown field of air.\\nThis is the principle of the van de Graaff\\ngenerator.

A schematic\\ndiagram of the van de Graaff generator is given\\nin Fig. 2.33.

A long narrow endless\\nbelt insulating material, like rubber or silk, is wound around two pulleys –\\none at ground level, one at the centre of the shell. This belt is kept\\ncontinuously moving by a motor driving the lower pulley. It continuously\\ncarries positive charge, sprayed on to it by a brush at ground level, to the\\ntop. There it transfers its positive charge to another conducting brush\\nconnected to the large shell. Thus positive charge is transferred to the\\nshell, where it spreads out uniformly on the outer surface.

Work done by an external\\nforce (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge\\nq from a point R to a point P is VP – VR, which is the difference in\\npotential energy of charge q between the final and initial points.\\n2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external\\nagency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a\\npoint is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential\\ndifference between two points which is physically significant.

Charges in a conductor can\\nreside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface\\nof a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the\\nelectric field is zero.\\n9.  A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its\\ncapacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on\\nthe two conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is\\ndetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative\\npositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,\\n1 F = 1 C V–1.

Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,\\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q– be the net amount of negative\\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\\ninterval t, then, is q = q+– q–. This is proportional to t for steady current\\nChapter Three\\nCURRENT\\nELECTRICITY'),\n",

(If it\\nturn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward\\ndirection.)\\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\\nthe current as follows. Let ∆ Q be the net charge flowing across a cross-\\nsection of a conductor during the time interval ∆ t [i.e., between times t\\nand (t + ∆ t)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆ Q to ∆ t in the limit of ∆ t\\ntending to zero,\\n( )\\n0\\nlim\\nt\\nQIt t∆→\\n∆≡ ∆ (3.2)\\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\\nchapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in\\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\\nour nerves are in microamperes.\\n3.3 ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS\\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged\\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules. These\\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\\nof fixed positive ions.\\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\\nas before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the\\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the'),\n",

So, there will be no net\\nelectric current.\\nLet us now see what happens to such a\\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\\nand similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach\\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\\nis directed from the positive towards the\\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\\ncurrent thereafter.\\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\\nstudy  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady\\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.\\n3.4  OHM’S LAW\\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\\nThen Ohm’s law states that\\n     V ∝  I\\nor, V = R I (3.3)\\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\\nΩ . The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges + Q and – Q put at the ends\\nof a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift\\nbecause of the electric field created to\\nneutralise the charges. The current thus\\nwill stop after a while unless the charges + Q\\nand –Q are continuously replenished.\\nFIGURE 3.2\\nIllustrating the\\nrelation R = ρ l/A for\\na rectangular slab\\nof length l and area\\nof cross-section A.'),\n",

The potential difference across the ends of the\\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The\\ncurrent through the combination is I and the resistance\\nof the combination RC is [from Eq. (3.3)],\\n2 2C\\nVRR I== (3.4)\\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,\\ndoubling the length of a conductor doubles the\\nresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to\\nlength,\\nRl∝ (3.5)\\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it\\nlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a\\ncombination of two identical slabs of length l, but each\\nhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current\\nthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing\\nthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the\\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\\nof the half-slabs R1 is\\n1 22 .(/ 2 )\\nVVRR II== = (3.6)\\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional\\nto the cross-sectional area,\\n1R A∝ (3.7)\\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\\nlR A∝ (3.8)\\nand hence for a given conductor\\nlR Aρ= (3.9)\\nwhere the constant of proportionality ρ  depends on the material of the\\nconductor but not on its dimensions. ρ  is called resistivity.\\nUsing the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\\nIlVIR A\\nρ=× = (3.10)\\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\\ncurrent density and is denoted by j.

In the next section, we\\nwill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the\\ncharacteristics of the drift of electrons.\\n3.5 D RIFT  OF E LECTRONS  AND  THE  O RIGIN  OF\\nRESISTIVITY\\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed\\nions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random\\ndirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\\nthe velocity of the ith electron (i = 1, 2, 3, ... N) at a given time is vi, then\\n1\\n1 0\\nN\\ni\\niN =\\n=∑ v (3.14)\\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\\nfield by\\n–e\\nm= Ea (3.15)\\nwhere –e is the charge and m is the mass of an electron.\\nConsider again the ith electron at a given time t. This\\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\\nbefore t, and let ti be the time elapsed after its last\\ncollision. If vi was its velocity immediately after the last\\ncollision, then its velocity Vi at time t is\\n–ii i\\ne tm= EVv (3.16)\\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated\\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a\\ntime interval ti. The average velocity of the electrons at\\ntime t is the average of all the Vi’s. The average of vi’s is\\nzero [Eq. (3.14)] since immediately after any collision,\\nthe direction of the velocity of an electron is completely\\nrandom. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\\nregular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\\nτ, the average time between successive collisions. Then\\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spent\\nFIGURE 3.3 A schematic picture of\\nan electron moving from a point A to\\nanother point B through repeated\\ncollisions, and straight line travel\\nbetween collisions (full lines).

In other words, the time ti in\\nEq. (3.16) will be less than τ  for some and more than τ  for others as we go\\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N.

E is directed towards the\\nleft and hence the total charge transported along E across the area is\\nnegative of this. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time ∆ t is by\\ndefinition [Eq.

Basically a cell has\\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in\\nFig. 3.18. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in the\\nsolution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The\\npositive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\\npotential  – (V– ) (V– ≥  0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\\nbetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called the\\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by ε . Thus\\nε  = V++V– >  0 (3.55)\\nNote that ε  is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\\nTo understand the significance of ε , consider a resistor R\\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.18). A current I flows across R\\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\\nbut from N to P, whereas through R, it flows from P to N.\\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\\nresistance r, called the internal resistance . Consider first the\\nsituation when R is infinite so that I = V/R = 0, where V is the\\npotential difference between P and N. Now,\\nV = Potential difference between P and A\\n       + Potential difference between A and B\\n       + Potential  difference between B and N\\n   = ε (3.56)\\nThus, emf ε  is the potential difference between the positive and\\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\\nflowing through the cell.\\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential\\ndifference between P and N is\\nV = V++ V– – I r\\n   = ε  – I r (3.57)\\nNote the negative sign in the expression (I r) for the potential difference\\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\\nelectrolyte.\\nIn  practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\\nmay be neglected when the  current I is such that ε  >> I r. The actual\\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\\nresistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common\\nelectrolytic cells.\\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) Sketch of\\nan electrolyte cell with\\npositive terminal P and\\nnegative terminal N.

However, in most cells the maximum allowed current is\\nmuch lower than this to prevent permanent damage to the cell.\\nCHARGES IN CLOUDS\\nIn olden days lightning was considered as an atmospheric flash of supernatural origin.\\nIt was believed to be the great weapon of Gods. But today the phenomenon of lightning\\ncan be explained scientifically by elementary principles of physics.\\nAtmospheric electricity arises due to the separation of electric charges. In the\\nionosphere and magnetosphere strong electric current is generated from the solar-\\nterrestrial interaction. In the lower atmosphere the current is weaker and is maintained\\nby thunderstorm.\\nThere are ice particles in the clouds, which grow, collide, fracture and break apart.\\nThe smaller particles acquire positive charge and the larger ones negative charge. These\\ncharged particles get separated by updrafts in the clouds and gravity. The upper portion\\nof the cloud becomes positively charged and the middle negatively charged, leading to\\ndipole structure. Sometimes a very weak positive charge is found near the base of the\\ncloud. The ground is positively charged at the time of thunderstorm development. Also\\ncosmic and radioactive radiations ionise air into positive and negative ions and air becomes\\n(weakly) electrically conductive. The separation of charges produce tremendous amount\\nof electrical potential within the cloud as well as between the cloud and ground. This can\\namount to millions of volts and eventually the electrical resistance in the air breaks\\ndown and lightning flash begins and thousands of amperes of current flows. The electric\\nfield is of the order of 105 V/m. A lightning flash is composed of a series of strokes with\\nan average of about four and the duration of each flash is about 30 seconds. The average\\npeak power per stroke is about 1012 watts.\\nDuring fair weather also there is charge in the atmosphere. The fair weather electric\\nfield arises due to the existence of a surface charge density at ground and an atmospheric\\nconductivity as well as due to the flow of current from the ionosphere to the earth’s\\nsurface, which is of the order of picoampere / square metre. The surface charge density\\nat ground is negative; the electric field is directed downward. Over land the average\\nelectric field is about 120 V/m, which corresponds to a surface charge density of\\n–1.2 × 10–9 C/m2. Over the entire earth’s surface, the total negative charge amount to\\nabout 600 kC. An equal positive charge exists in the atmosphere. This electric field is not\\nnoticeable in daily life. The reason why it is not noticed is that virtually everything, including\\nour bodies, is conductor compared to air.'),\n",

If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled\\nas well as a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\\nthe cell.

Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\\nper unit time through the area.\\n2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\\n3. Ohm’s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is\\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V ∝  I or V = RI,\\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance\\nis ohm: 1Ω  = 1 V A–1.\\n4. The resistance R of a conductor depends on its length l and constant\\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\\nlR A\\nρ=\\nwhere ρ , called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on\\ntemperature and pressure.\\n5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10 –8 Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. Insulators\\nlike glass and rubber have 10 22 to 10 24 times greater resistivity.\\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\\n6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\\n7. Current density j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\\nunit area normal to the flow,\\nj = nq vd\\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\\ncarriers each of charge q, and vd is the drift velocity  of the charge\\ncarriers. For electrons q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\\nthe area is nevd A.'),\n",

However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\\nrealised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration\\nin the summer of 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted\\nnoticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in\\na nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon.\\nHe found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary\\ncircle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane\\nperpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is\\nnoticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to\\nthe wire so that the earth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the\\ndirection of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)].\\nThe deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle\\ncloser to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange\\nthemselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)].\\nOersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a\\nmagnetic field in the surrounding space .\\nFollowing this there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\\nChapter Four\\nMOVING CHARGES\\nAND MAGNETISM\\n* See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3.'),\n",

We write it as F = Gm1m2/r2\\nwhere G is the universal constant of gravitation. Similarly in Coulomb’s law of electrostatics\\nwe write the force between two point charges q1, q2, separated by a distance r as\\nF = kq1q2/r2 where k is a constant of proportionality. In SI units, k is taken as\\n1/4π ε  where ε  is the permittivity of the medium. Also in magnetism, we get another\\nconstant, which in SI units, is taken as µ /4π where µ  is the permeability of the medium.\\nAlthough G, ε  and µ  arise as proportionality constants, there is a difference between\\ngravitational force and electromagnetic force. While the gravitational force does not depend\\non the intervening medium, the electromagnetic force depends on the medium between\\nthe two charges or magnets. Hence while G is a universal constant, ε  and µ  depend on\\nthe medium. They have different values for different media. The product εµ turns out to\\nbe related to the speed v of electromagnetic radiation in the medium through εµ  =1/ v 2.\\nElectric permittivity ε  is a physical quantity that describes how an electric field affects\\nand is affected by a medium. It is determined by the ability of a material to polarise in\\nresponse to an applied field, and thereby to cancel, partially, the field inside the material.\\nSimilarly, magnetic permeability µ  is the ability of a substance to acquire magnetisation in\\nmagnetic fields. It is a measure of the extent to which magnetic field can penetrate matter.\\nExample 4.1 A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries\\na current of 2 A.

Let this velocity have a component vp parallel to the\\nmagnetic field and a component vn normal to it. There is no force on a charged particle in\\nthe direction of the field. Hence the particle continues to travel with the velocity vp parallel\\nto the field. The normal component vn of the particle results in a Lorentz force (vn × B)\\nwhich is perpendicular to both vn and B. As seen in Section 4.3.1 the particle thus has a\\ntendency to perform a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field.\\nWhen this is coupled with the velocity parallel to the field, the resulting trajectory will be\\na helix along the magnetic field line, as shown in Figure (a) here. Even if the field line\\nbends, the helically moving particle is trapped and guided to move around the field line.\\nSince the Lorentz force is normal to the velocity of each point, the field does no work on\\nthe particle and the magnitude of velocity remains the same.\\nDuring a solar flare, a large number of electrons and protons are ejected from the sun.\\nSome of them get trapped in the earth’s magnetic field and move in helical paths along the\\nfield lines. The field lines come closer to each other near the magnetic poles; see figure (b).\\nHence the density of charges increases near the poles. These particles collide with atoms\\nand molecules of the atmosphere. Excited oxygen atoms emit green light and excited\\nnitrogen atoms emits pink light. This phenomenon is called Aurora Boriolis in physics.'),\n",

It was invented by E.O. Lawrence and M.S. Livingston in 1934\\nto investigate nuclear structure. The cyclotron uses both electric and\\nmagnetic fields in combination to increase the energy of charged particles.\\nAs the fields are perpendicular to each other they are called crossed\\nfields. Cyclotron uses the fact that the frequency of revolution of the\\ncharged particle in a magnetic field is independent of its energy. The\\nparticles move most of the time inside two semicircular disc-like metal\\ncontainers, D1 and D2, which are called dees as they look like the letter\\nD. Figure 4.8 shows a schematic view of the cyclotron.  Inside the metal\\nboxes the particle is shielded and is not acted on by the electric field. The\\nmagnetic field, however, acts on the particle and makes it go round in a\\ncircular path inside a dee. Every time the particle moves from one dee to\\nanother it is acted upon by the electric field. The sign of the electric field\\nis changed alternately in tune with the circular motion of the particle.\\nThis ensures that the particle is always accelerated by the electric field.\\nEach time the acceleration increases the energy of the particle.

Ampere’s circuital law considers an open  surface\\nwith a boundary (Fig. 4.14). The surface has current passing\\nthrough it. We consider the boundary to be made up of a number\\nof small line elements. Consider one such element of length dl. We\\ntake the value of the tangential component of the magnetic field,\\nBt, at this element and multiply it by the length of that element dl\\n[Note: B tdl=B.dl]. All such products are added together. We\\nconsider the limit as the lengths of elements get smaller and their\\nnumber gets larger. The sum then tends to an integral. Ampere’s\\nlaw states that this integral is  equal to µ 0 times the total current\\npassing through  the surface,  i.e.,\\n0dI µ=∫ Bl/G67/GD1 [4.17(a)]\\nwhere I  is the total current through the surface. The integral is taken\\nover the closed loop coinciding with the boundary C of the surface. The\\nrelation above involves a sign-convention, given by the right-hand rule.\\nLet the fingers of the right-hand be curled in the sense the boundary is\\ntraversed in the loop integral “B.dl. Then the direction of the thumb\\ngives the sense in which the current I  is regarded as positive.\\nFor several applications, a much simplified version of Eq. [4.17(a)]\\nproves sufficient. We shall assume that, in such cases, it is possible to\\nchoose the loop (called an amperian loop) such that at each point of the\\nloop, either\\nFIGURE 4.14  EXAMPLE 4.7'),\n",

Let Ie  be the current enclosed by the loop.\\nThen, Eq. (4.17) reduces to,\\nBL =µ 0Ie [4.17(b)]\\nWhen there is a system with a symmetry such as for\\na straight infinite current-carrying wire in Fig. 4.15, the\\nAmpere’s law enables an easy evaluation of the magnetic\\nfield, much the same way Gauss’ law helps in\\ndetermination of the electric field. This is exhibited in the\\nExample 4.8 below. The boundary of the loop chosen is\\na circle and magnetic field is tangential to the\\ncircumference of the circle. The law gives, for the left hand\\nside of Eq. [4.17 (b)], B. 2π r. We find that the magnetic\\nfield at a distance r outside the wire is tangential and\\ngiven by\\nB × 2πr  =  µ 0 I,\\nB = µ 0  I/ (2πr) (4.18)\\nThe above result for the infinite wire  is interesting\\nfrom several points of view.\\n(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\\npossesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The\\nfield that normally can depend on three coordinates\\ndepends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry,\\nthe solutions simplify.\\n(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is\\ntangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude\\nof magnetic field form concentric circles. Notice now,\\nin Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form concentric circles.\\nThese lines called magnetic field lines  form closed\\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which\\noriginate from positive charges and end at negative\\ncharges. The expression for the magnetic field of a\\nstraight wire provides a theoretical justification to\\nOersted’s experiments.\\n(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though\\nthe wire is infinite, the field due to it at a nonzero\\ndistance is not infinite. It tends to blow up only when\\nwe come very close to the wire.

If the magnetic field is\\nnon-uniform, but does not change much during one circular orbit, then the radius of the\\nhelix will decrease as it enters stronger magnetic field  and the radius will increase when it\\nenters weaker  magnetic fields.

Another useful container\\nis a toroid. Toroids are expected to play a key role in the tokamak, an equipment for plasma\\nconfinement in fusion power reactors.

It is a device whose principle can be understood\\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.10.\\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.24), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\\nthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.26) to be\\nτ  = NI AB\\nwhere the symbols have their usual meaning. Since the field is radial by\\ndesign, we have taken sin θ  = 1 in the above expression for the torque.\\nThe magnetic torque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring Sp provides a\\ncounter torque kφ  that balances the magnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a\\nsteady angular deflection φ . In equilibrium\\nkφ  = NI AB\\nwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the restoring torque\\nper unit twist. The deflection φ  is indicated on the scale by a pointer\\nattached to the spring. We have\\nNAB Ikφ \\uf8eb\\uf8f6= \\uf8ec\\uf8f7\\uf8ed\\uf8f8 (4.38)\\nThe quantity in brackets is a constant for a given\\ngalvanometer.\\nThe galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.\\nIt can be used as a detector to check if a current is\\nflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage\\nin the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage\\nthe neutral position of the pointer (when no current is\\nflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of\\nthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.24.\\nDepending on the direction of the current, the pointer\\ndeflection is either to the right or the left.\\nThe galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given\\ncircuit. This is for two reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a\\nvery sensitive device, it gives a full-scale deflection for\\na current of the order of µ A. (ii) For measuring\\ncurrents, the galvanometer has to be connected in\\nseries, and as it has a large resistance, this will change\\nthe value of the current in the circuit. To overcome\\nthese difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs,\\ncalled shunt resistance , in parallel with\\nthe galvanometer coil; so that most of the current\\npasses through the shunt. The resistance of this\\narrangement is,\\nRG rs / (RG  + rs)    /G3B  rs         if    RG >>  rs\\nIf rs has small value, in relation to the resistance of\\nthe rest of the circuit Rc, the effect of introducing the\\nmeasuring instrument is also small and negligible. This\\nFIGURE 4.24 The moving coil\\ngalvanometer. Its elements are\\ndescribed in the text.

The scale of this\\nammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off the current value\\nwith ease. We define the current sensitivity of the galvanometer as the\\ndeflection per unit current. From Eq. (4.38) this current sensitivity is,\\nNAB\\nIk\\nφ = (4.39)\\nA convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity is\\nto increase the number of turns N. We choose galvanometers having\\nsensitivities of value, required by our experiment.\\nThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the\\nvoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected\\nin parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure\\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.\\nThis arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.26. Note that the\\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\\nRG + R/G3B R :  large\\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value\\nwith ease.

Let us take Eq. (4.39)\\nwhich provides a measure of current sensitivity. If N →  2N, i.e., we double\\nthe number of turns, then\\n2II\\nφφ →\\nThus, the current sensitivity doubles. However, the resistance of the\\ngalvanometer is also likely to double, since it is proportional to the length\\nof the wire. In Eq.

Vast, distant galaxies, the\\ntiny invisible atoms, men and beasts all are permeated through and\\nthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s\\nmagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from\\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore\\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island\\ncomplained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed\\nstruck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This\\nattractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.\\nThe directional property of magnets was also known since ancient\\ntimes. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in\\nthe north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed\\non a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name\\nlodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-\\nmagnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this\\nproperty is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400\\nBC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans\\ncrossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.\\nA Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti\\nabout four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom\\nChapter Five\\nMAGNETISM AND\\nMATTER'),\n",

These ‘engineers’\\nbuilt a chariot on which they placed a magnetic figure\\nwith arms outstretched. Figure 5.1 is an artist’s\\ndescription of this chariot. The figure swiveled around\\nso that the finger of the statuette on it always pointed\\nsouth. With this chariot, Huang-ti’s troops were able\\nto attack the enemy from the rear in thick fog, and to\\ndefeat them.\\nIn the previous chapter we have learned that moving\\ncharges or electric currents produce magnetic fields.\\nThis discovery, which was made in the early part of the\\nnineteenth century is credited to Oersted, Ampere, Biot\\nand Savart, among others.\\nIn the present chapter, we take a look at magnetism\\nas a subject in its own right.\\nSome of the commonly known ideas regarding\\nmagnetism are:\\n(i) The earth behaves as a magnet with the magnetic\\nfield pointing approximately from the geographic\\nsouth to the north.\\n(ii) When a bar magnet is freely suspended, it points in  the north-south\\ndirection. The tip which points to the geographic north is called the\\nnorth pole and the tip which points to the geographic south is called\\nthe south pole of the magnet.\\n(iii) There is a repulsive force when north poles ( or south poles ) of two\\nmagnets are brought close together. Conversely, there is an attractive\\nforce between the north pole of one magnet and the south pole of\\nthe other.\\n(iv) We cannot isolate the north, or south pole of a magnet. If a bar magnet\\nis broken into two halves, we get two similar bar magnets with\\nsomewhat weaker properties. Unlike electric charges, isolated magnetic\\nnorth and south poles known as magnetic monopoles do not exist.\\n(v) It is possible to make magnets out of iron and its alloys.\\nWe begin with a description of a bar magnet and its behaviour in an\\nexternal magnetic field. We describe Gauss’s law of magnetism. We then\\nfollow it up with an account of the earth’s magnetic field. We next describe\\nhow materials can be classified on the basis of their magnetic properties.\\nWe describe para-, dia-, and ferromagnetism. We conclude with a section\\non electromagnets and permanent magnets.\\n5.2  THE BAR MAGNET\\nOne of the earliest childhood memories of the famous physicist Albert\\nEinstein was that of a magnet gifted to him by a relative. Einstein was\\nfascinated, and played endlessly with it. He wondered how the magnet\\ncould affect objects such as nails or pins placed away from it and not in\\nany way connected to it by a spring or string.\\nFIGURE 5.1 The arm of the statuette\\nmounted on the chariot always points\\nsouth.

The arrangement of iron filings is\\nshown in Fig. 5.2.\\n The pattern of iron filings suggests that the magnet has two poles\\nsimilar to the positive and negative charge of an electric dipole. As\\nmentioned in the introductory section, one pole is designated the North\\npole and the other, the South pole. When suspended freely, these poles\\npoint approximately towards the geographic north and south poles,\\nrespectively. A similar pattern of iron filings is observed around a current\\ncarrying solenoid.\\n5.2.1  The magnetic field lines\\nThe pattern of iron filings permits us to plot the magnetic field lines*. This is\\nshown both for the bar-magnet and the current-carrying solenoid in\\nFig. 5.3. For comparison refer to the Chapter 1, Figure 1.17(d). Electric field\\nlines of an electric dipole are also displayed in Fig. 5.3(c). The magnetic field\\nlines are a visual and intuitive realisation of the magnetic field. Their\\nproperties are:\\n(i) The magnetic field lines of a magnet (or a solenoid) form continuous\\nclosed loops. This is unlike the electric dipole where these field lines\\nbegin from a positive charge and end on the negative charge or escape\\nto infinity.\\n(ii) The tangent to the field line at a given point represents the direction of\\nthe net magnetic field B at that point.\\nFIGURE 5.2 The\\narrangement of iron\\nfilings surrounding a\\nbar magnet.

Unlike electrostatics\\nthe field lines in magnetism do not indicate the direction of the force on a\\n(moving) charge.\\nFIGURE 5.3 The field lines of (a) a bar magnet, (b) a current-carrying finite solenoid and\\n(c) electric dipole.

In Fig. 5.3(a), B is larger\\naround region  ii  than in region  i  .\\n(iv) The magnetic field lines do not intersect, for if they did, the direction\\nof the magnetic field would not be unique at the point of intersection.\\nOne can plot the magnetic field lines in a variety of ways. One way is\\nto place a small magnetic compass needle at various positions and note\\nits orientation. This gives us an idea of the magnetic field direction at\\nvarious points in space.\\n5.2.2  Bar magnet as an equivalent solenoid\\nIn the previous chapter, we have explained how a current loop acts as a\\nmagnetic dipole (Section 4.10). We mentioned Ampere’s hypothesis that\\nall magnetic phenomena can be explained in terms of circulating currents.\\nRecall that the magnetic dipole moment m\\nassociated with a current loop was defined\\nto be m = NIA where N is the number of\\nturns in the loop, I the current and A the\\narea vector (Eq. 4.30).\\nThe resemblance of magnetic field lines\\nfor a bar magnet and a solenoid suggest that\\na bar magnet may be thought of as a large\\nnumber of circulating currents in analogy\\nwith a solenoid. Cutting a bar magnet in half\\nis like cutting a solenoid. We get two smaller\\nsolenoids with weaker magnetic properties.\\nThe field lines remain continuous, emerging\\nfrom one face of the solenoid and entering\\ninto the other face. One can test this analogy\\nby moving a small compass needle in the\\nneighbourhood of a bar magnet and a\\ncurrent-carrying finite solenoid and noting\\nthat the deflections of the needle are similar\\nin both cases.\\nTo make this analogy more firm we\\ncalculate the axial field of a finite solenoid\\ndepicted in Fig. 5.4 (a). We shall demonstrate\\nthat at large distances this axial field\\nresembles that of a bar magnet.\\nLet the solenoid of Fig. 5.4(a) consists of\\nn turns per unit length. Let its length be 2l\\nand radius a. We can evaluate the axial field\\nat a point P, at a distance r from the centre O\\nof the solenoid. To do this, consider a circular element of thickness dx of\\nthe solenoid at a distance x from its centre. It consists of n d x turns. Let\\nI be the current in the solenoid. In Section 4.6 of the previous chapter we\\nhave calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a circular current loop.\\nFrom Eq. (4.13), the magnitude of the field at point P due to the circular\\nelement is\\nFIGURE 5.4 (a) Calculation of the axial field of a\\nfinite solenoid in order to demonstrate its similarity\\nto that of a bar magnet.

The strength of\\nthe earth’s magnetic field varies from place to place on the earth’s surface;\\nits value being of the order of 10–5 T.\\nWhat causes the earth to have a magnetic field is not clear. Originally\\nthe magnetic field was thought of as arising from a giant bar magnet\\nplaced approximately along the axis of rotation of the earth and deep in\\nthe interior. However, this simplistic picture is certainly not correct. The\\nmagnetic field is now thought to arise due to electrical currents produced\\nby convective motion of metallic fluids (consisting mostly of molten\\niron and nickel) in the outer core of the earth. This is known as the\\ndynamo effect.\\nThe magnetic field lines of the earth resemble that of a (hypothetical)\\nmagnetic dipole located at the centre of the earth. The axis of the dipole\\ndoes not coincide with the axis of rotation of the earth but is presently\\ntitled by approximately 11.3º with respect to the later. In this way of looking\\nat it, the magnetic poles are located where the magnetic field lines due to\\nthe dipole enter or leave the earth. The location of the north magnetic pole\\nis at a latitude of 79.74º N and a longitude of 71.8º W, a place somewhere\\nin north Canada. The magnetic south pole is at 79.74º S, 108.22º E in the\\nAntarctica.\\nThe pole near the geographic north pole of the earth is called the north\\nmagnetic pole.

There is some confusion in the\\nnomenclature of the poles. If one looks at the magnetic\\nfield lines of the earth (Fig. 5.8), one sees that unlike in the\\ncase of a bar magnet, the field lines go into the earth at the\\nnorth magnetic pole (Nm) and come out from the south\\nmagnetic pole ( Sm). The convention arose because the\\nmagnetic north was the direction to which the north\\npole of a magnetic needle pointed; the north pole of\\na magnet was so named as it was the north seeking\\npole. Thus, in reality, the north magnetic pole behaves\\nlike the south pole of a bar magnet inside the earth and\\nvice versa.\\nExample 5.8 The earth’s magnetic field at the equator is approximately\\n0.4 G.

At such a point, the direction of\\nthe longitude circle determines the geographic north-south direction, the\\nline of longitude towards the north pole being the direction of\\ntrue north. The vertical plane containing the longitude circle\\nand the axis of rotation of the earth is called the geographic\\nmeridian. In a similar way, one can define magnetic meridian\\nof a place as the vertical plane which passes through the\\nimaginary line joining the magnetic north and the south poles.\\nThis plane would intersect the surface of the earth in a\\nlongitude like circle. A magnetic needle, which is free to swing\\nhorizontally, would then lie in the magnetic meridian and the\\nnorth pole of the needle would point towards the magnetic\\nnorth pole. Since the line joining the magnetic poles is titled\\nwith respect to the geographic axis of the earth, the magnetic\\nmeridian at a point makes angle with the geographic meridian.\\nThis, then, is the angle between the true geographic north and\\nthe north shown by a compass needle. This angle is called the\\nmagnetic declination or simply declination (Fig. 5.9).\\nThe declination is greater at higher latitudes and smaller\\nnear the equator. The declination in India is small, it being\\nFIGURE 5.8 The earth as a giant\\nmagnetic dipole.\\nFIGURE 5.9 A magnetic needle\\nfree to move in horizontal plane,\\npoints toward the magnetic\\nnorth-south\\ndirection.'),\n",

Thus, at both these places a\\nmagnetic needle shows the true north quite accurately.\\nThere is one more quantity of interest. If a magnetic needle is perfectly\\nbalanced about a horizontal axis so that it can swing in a plane of the\\nmagnetic meridian, the needle would make an angle with the horizontal\\n(Fig. 5.10). This is known as the angle of dip (also known as inclination).\\nThus, dip is the angle that the total magnetic field BE of the earth makes\\nwith the surface of the earth. Figure 5.11 shows the magnetic meridian\\nplane at a point P on the surface of the earth. The plane is a section through\\nthe earth. The total magnetic field at P\\ncan be resolved into a horizontal\\ncomponent HE and a vertical\\ncomponent ZE. The angle that BE makes\\nwith HE is the angle of dip, I.\\nIn most of the northern hemisphere, the north pole of the dip needle\\ntilts downwards. Likewise in most of the southern hemisphere, the south\\npole of the dip needle tilts downwards.\\nTo describe the magnetic field of the earth at a point on its surface, we\\nneed to specify three quantities, viz., the declination D, the angle of dip or\\nthe inclination I and the horizontal component of the earth’s field HE.

Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic\\nmeridian of the place.

The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to\\nbe given by\\nEARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD\\nIt must not be assumed that there is a giant bar magnet deep inside the earth which is\\ncausing the earth’s magnetic field. Although there are large deposits of iron inside the earth,\\nit is highly unlikely that a large solid block of iron stretches from the magnetic north pole to\\nthe magnetic south pole. The earth’s core is very hot and molten, and the ions of iron and\\nnickel are responsible for earth’s magnetism. This hypothesis seems very probable. Moon,\\nwhich has no molten core, has no magnetic field, Venus has a slower rate of rotation, and a\\nweaker magnetic field, while Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate among planets, has\\na fairly strong magnetic field. However, the precise mode of these circulating currents and\\nthe energy needed to sustain them are not very well understood. These are several open\\nquestions which form an important area of continuing research.\\nThe variation of the earth’s magnetic field with position is also an  interesting area of\\nstudy. Charged particles emitted by the sun flow towards the earth and beyond, in a stream\\ncalled the solar wind. Their motion is affected by the earth’s magnetic field, and in turn, they\\naffect the pattern of the earth’s magnetic field. The pattern of magnetic field near the poles is\\nquite different from that in other regions of the earth.\\nThe variation of earth’s magnetic field with time is no less  fascinating. There are short\\nterm variations taking place over centuries and long term variations taking place over a\\nperiod of a million years. In a span of 240 years from 1580 to 1820 AD, over which records\\nare available, the magnetic declination at London has been found to change by 3.5º,\\nsuggesting that the magnetic poles inside the earth change position with time. On the scale\\nof a million years, the earth’s magnetic fields has been found to reverse its direction. Basalt\\ncontains iron, and basalt is emitted during volcanic activity. The little iron magnets inside it\\nalign themselves parallel to the magnetic field at that place as the basalt cools and solidifies.\\nGeological studies of basalt containing such pieces of magnetised region have provided\\nevidence for the change of direction of earth’s magnetic field, several times in the past.'),\n",

We have partitioned the contribution\\nto the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to\\nexternal factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented\\nby H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,\\nnamely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors.

When placed in a\\nnon-uniform magnetic field, the bar will tend to move from high to low field.\\nThe simplest explanation for diamagnetism is as follows. Electrons in\\nan atom orbiting around nucleus possess orbital angular momentum.\\nThese orbiting electrons are equivalent to current-carrying loop and thus\\npossess orbital magnetic moment. Diamagnetic substances are the ones\\nin which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic\\nfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the\\nsame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.\\nThis happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which\\nyou will study in Chapter 6. Thus, the substance develops a net magnetic\\nmoment in direction opposite to that of the applied field and hence\\nrepulsion.\\nSome diamagnetic materials are bismuth, copper, lead, silicon,\\nnitrogen (at STP), water and sodium chloride. Diamagnetism is present\\nin all the substances. However, the effect is so weak in most cases that it\\ngets shifted by other effects like paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, etc.\\nThe most exotic diamagnetic materials are superconductors. These\\nare metals, cooled to very low temperatures which exhibits both perfect\\nconductivity and perfect diamagnetism. Here the field lines are completely\\nexpelled!  χ  = –1 and µ r = 0. A superconductor repels a magnet and (by\\nNewton’s third law) is repelled by the magnet. The phenomenon of perfect\\ndiamagnetism in superconductors is called the Meissner effect, after the\\nname of its discoverer. Superconducting magnets can be gainfully\\nexploited in variety of situations, for example, for running magnetically\\nlevitated superfast trains.\\n5.6.2  Paramagnetism\\nParamagnetic substances are those which get weakly magnetised when\\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have tendency to move from a\\nregion of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get weakly\\nattracted to a magnet.\\nTABLE 5.3\\nDiamagnetic Paramagnetic Ferromagnetic\\n–1 ≤ χ  < 0 0 < χ  <  εχ  >> 1\\n0 ≤ µ r < 1 1< µ r < 1+ εµ r >> 1\\nµ  < µ 0 µ  > µ 0 µ  >> µ 0\\nFIGURE 5.12\\nBehaviour of\\nmagnetic field lines\\nnear a\\n(a) diamagnetic,\\n(b) paramagnetic\\nsubstance.'),\n",

On account\\nof the ceaseless random thermal motion of the atoms, no net magnetisation\\nis seen. In the presence of an external field B0, which is strong enough,\\nand at low temperatures, the individual atomic dipole moment can be\\nmade to align and point in the same direction as B0. Figure 5.12(b) shows\\na bar of paramagnetic material placed in an external field. The field lines\\ngets concentrated inside the material, and the field inside is enhanced.

Experimentally, one finds that the\\nmagnetisation of a paramagnetic material is inversely proportional to the\\nabsolute temperature T,\\n0BMC T= [5.20(a)]\\nor equivalently, using Eqs. (5.12) and (5.17)\\n0C T\\nµχ = [5.20(b)]\\nThis is known as Curie’s law, after its discoverer Pieree Curie (1859-\\n1906). The constant C is called Curie’s constant. Thus, for a paramagnetic\\nmaterial both   χ and µ r depend not only on the material, but also\\n(in a simple fashion) on the sample temperature. As the field is\\nincreased or the temperature is lowered, the magnetisation increases until\\nit reaches the saturation value Ms, at which point all the dipoles are\\nperfectly aligned with the field. Beyond this, Curie’s law [Eq. (5.20)] is no\\nlonger valid.\\n5.6.3  Ferromagnetism\\nFerromagnetic substances are those which gets strongly magnetised when\\nplaced in an external magnetic field. They have strong tendency to move\\nfrom a region of weak magnetic field to strong magnetic field, i.e., they get\\nstrongly attracted to a magnet.\\nThe individual atoms (or ions or molecules) in a ferromagnetic material\\npossess a dipole moment as in a paramagnetic material. However, they\\ninteract with one another in such a way that they spontaneously align\\nthemselves in a common direction over a macroscopic volume called\\ndomain. The explanation of this cooperative effect requires quantum\\nmechanics and is beyond the scope of this textbook. Each domain has a\\nnet magnetisation. Typical domain size is 1mm and the domain contains\\nabout 1011 atoms. In the first instant, the magnetisation varies randomly\\nfrom domain to domain and there is no bulk magnetisation. This is shown\\nin Fig. 5.13(a). When we apply an external magnetic field B0, the domains\\norient themselves in the direction of B0 and simultaneously the domain\\noriented in the direction of B0 grow in size. This existence of domains and\\ntheir motion in B0 are not speculations. One may observe this under a\\nmicroscope after sprinkling a liquid suspension of powdered\\nFIGURE 5.13\\n(a) Randomly\\noriented domains,\\n(b) Aligned domains.\\nMagnetic materials, domain, etc.:\\n/G68/G74/G74/G70/G3A/G2F/G2F/G77/G77/G77/G2E/G61/G61/G63/G67/G2E/G62/G68/G61/G6D/G2E/G61/G63/G2E/G75/G6B/G2F/G6D/G61/G67/G6E/G65/G74/G69/G63/G5F/G6D/G61/G74/G65/G72/G69/G61/G6C/G73/G2F'),\n",

This motion of suspension can be\\nobserved. Figure 5.12(b) shows the situation when the domains have\\naligned and amalgamated to form a single ‘giant’ domain.\\n Thus, in a ferromagnetic material the field lines are highly\\nconcentrated. In non-uniform magnetic field, the sample tends to move\\ntowards the region of high field. We may wonder as to what happens\\nwhen the external field is removed. In some ferromagnetic materials the\\nmagnetisation persists. Such materials are called hard magnetic materials\\nor hard ferromagnets. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminium, nickel, cobalt\\nand copper, is one such material. The naturally occurring lodestone is\\nanother.

Let the material be unmagnetised initially. We\\nplace it in a solenoid and increase the current through the\\nsolenoid. The magnetic field B in the material rises and\\nsaturates as depicted in the curve Oa. This behaviour\\nrepresents the alignment and merger of domains until no\\nfurther enhancement is possible. It is pointless to increase\\nthe current (and hence the magnetic intensity H) beyond\\nthis. Next, we decrease H and reduce it to zero. At H = 0, B\\n≠ 0. This is represented by the curve ab. The value of B at\\nH = 0 is called retentivity or remanence. In Fig. 5.14, BR ~\\n1.2 T, where the subscript R denotes retentivity. The\\ndomains are not completely randomised even though the\\nexternal driving field has been removed. Next, the current\\nin the solenoid is reversed and slowly increased.

As\\nthe reversed current is increased in magnitude, we once\\nagain obtain saturation. The curve cd depicts this. The\\nsaturated magnetic field Bs ~ 1.5 T.

A satisfactory understanding of magnetic phenomenon in terms of moving\\ncharges/currents was arrived at after 1800 AD. But technological\\nexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific\\nunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is\\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\\ntandem.\\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\\nelectronic charge with value | e| = 1.6 ×10 –19 C. All other charges are\\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\\nelectric charge is quantised.\\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\\n4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The\\nearth’s core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core\\nare responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect\\nsustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every\\nmillion years or so, we do not know.\\n5. A miniscule difference in the value of χ , the magnetic susceptibility, yields\\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For\\ndiamagnetic materials χ  = – 10–5 whereas χ  = +10 –5 for paramagnetic\\nmaterials.\\n6. There exists a perfect diamagnet , namely, a superconductor. This is a\\nmetal at very low temperatures. In this case χ  = –1, µ r = 0, µ  = 0. The\\nexternal magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is\\nalso a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which\\nties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by\\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The\\nBCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel\\nPrize in physics in 1970.\\n7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar\\nbehaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain\\nmay not be proportional to stress; here H and B (or M) are not\\nlinearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and\\narea enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume.\\nA similar interpretation can be given to the B-H magnetic hysteresis\\ncurve.\\n8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it\\nis weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.\\n9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and\\nferromagnetic. However, there exist additional types of magnetic material\\nsuch as ferrimagnetic, anti-ferromagnetic, spin glass, etc. with properties\\nwhich are exotic and mysterious.'),\n",

When the magnet is pulled\\naway from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in\\nthe opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the\\ncurrent’s direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of\\nthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from the\\ncoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite\\nto that observed with the North-pole for similar\\nmovements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)\\nis found to be larger when the magnet is pushed\\ntowards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,\\nwhen the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is\\nmoved towards or away from the magnet, the same\\neffects are observed.

This indicates that electric current is induced in\\ncoil C1. When C2 is moved away, the galvanometer shows a\\ndeflection again, but this time in the opposite direction. The\\ndeflection lasts as long as coil C2 is in motion. When the coil\\nC2 is held fixed and C1 is moved, the same effects are observed.\\nAgain, it is the relative motion between the coils that induces\\nthe electric current .\\nExperiment 6.3\\nThe above two experiments involved relative motion between\\na magnet and a coil and between two coils, respectively.\\nThrough another experiment, Faraday showed that this\\nrelative motion is not an absolute requirement.

It is also observed\\nthat the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted\\ninto the coils along their axis.\\n6.3  MAGNETIC FLUX\\nFaraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation\\nto explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic\\ninduction.

A = BA cos θ (6.1)\\nwhere θ   is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector\\nhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be\\nextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields.\\nIf the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at\\nvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic\\nflux through the surface is given by\\n112 2ddBΦ =++BABAii ... =\\nall\\ndii∑BAi (6.2)\\nwhere ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements d Ai\\ncomprising the surface and Bi is the magnetic field at the area element\\ndAi. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter\\nsquared (T m2). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity.\\n6.4  FARADAY’S LAW OF INDUCTION\\nFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a\\nconclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux\\nthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observations\\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C 1 in\\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards\\nor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\\nflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces\\nemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric\\ncurrent to flow in coil C 1 and through the galvanometer. A\\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,\\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in\\ncoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the\\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C1\\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C 1*. The common\\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\\ninduction. The law is stated below.\\nFIGURE 6.4 A plane of\\nsurface area A placed in a\\nuniform magnetic field B.\\nFIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field Bi\\nat the i th area element. dA i\\nrepresents area vector of the\\nith area element.\\n* Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.'),\n",

The flux can also be altered by\\nchanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or\\nstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a\\nmagnetic field such that the angle θ  between B and A\\nchanges.

The statement of the law is:\\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\\ndirection shown by  and  indicate the directions of the induced\\ncurrents.\\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\\nand hence can not happen.\\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.\\nFIGURE 6.6\\nIllustration of\\nLenz’s law.'),\n",

Even when bulk pieces of conductors\\nare subjected to changing magnetic flux, induced currents\\nare produced in them. However, their flow patterns resemble\\nswirling eddies in water. This effect was discovered by physicist\\nFoucault (1819-1868) and these currents are called eddy\\ncurrents .\\nConsider the apparatus shown in Fig. 6.13. A copper plate\\nis allowed to swing like a simple pendulum between the pole\\npieces of a strong magnet. It is found that the motion is damped\\nand in a little while the plate comes to a halt in the magnetic\\nfield. We can explain this phenomenon on the basis of\\nelectromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux associated with the\\nplate keeps on changing as the plate moves in and out of the\\nregion between magnetic poles. The flux change induces eddy\\ncurrents in the plate.  Directions of eddy currents are opposite\\nwhen the plate swings into the region between the poles and\\nwhen it swings out of the region.\\nIf rectangular slots are made in the copper plate as shown\\nin Fig. 6.14, area available to the flow of eddy currents is less.\\nThus, the pendulum plate with holes or slots reduces\\nelectromagnetic damping and the plate swings more freely.\\nNote that magnetic moments of the induced currents (which\\noppose the motion) depend upon the area enclosed by the\\ncurrents (recall equation m = IA in Chapter 4).\\nThis fact is helpful in reducing eddy currents in the metallic\\ncores of transformers, electric motors and other such devices in\\nwhich a coil is  to be wound over metallic core. Eddy currents are\\nundesirable since they heat up the core and dissipate electrical\\nenergy in the form of heat. Eddy currents are minimised by using\\nlaminations of metal to make a metal core. The laminations are\\nseparated by an insulating material like lacquer. The plane of the\\nlaminations must be arranged parallel to the magnetic field, so\\nthat they cut across the eddy current paths. This arrangement\\nreduces the strength of the eddy currents. Since the dissipation\\nof electrical energy into heat depends on the square of the strength\\nof electric current, heat loss is substantially reduced.\\nEddy currents are used to advantage in certain applications like:\\n(i) Magnetic braking in trains: Strong electromagnets are situated\\nabove the rails in some electrically powered trains. When the\\nelectromagnets are activated, the eddy currents induced in the\\nrails oppose the motion of the train. As there are no mechanical\\nlinkages, the braking effect is smooth.\\n(ii) Electromagnetic damping: Certain galvanometers have a fixed\\ncore made of nonmagnetic metallic material. When the coil\\noscillates, the eddy currents generated in the core oppose the\\nmotion and bring the coil to rest quickly.\\nFIGURE 6.13 Eddy currents are\\ngenerated in the copper plate,\\nwhile entering\\nand leaving the region of\\nmagnetic field.\\nFIGURE 6.14 Cutting slots\\nin the copper plate reduces\\nthe effect of eddy currents.'),\n",

Note the time it takes to come out of the pipe in each case. You will  see that\\nthe magnet takes much longer time in the case of aluminium pipe. Why is it so? It is due to\\nthe eddy currents that are generated in the aluminium pipe which oppose the change in\\nmagnetic flux, i.e., the motion of the magnet. The retarding force due to the eddy currents\\ninhibits the motion of the magnet. Such phenomena are referred to as electromagnetic damping.\\nNote that eddy currents are not generated in PVC pipe as its material is an insulator whereas\\naluminium is a conductor.\\n6.9  INDUCTANCE\\nAn electric current can be induced in a coil by flux change produced by\\nanother coil in its vicinity or flux change produced by the same coil. These\\ntwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections.\\nHowever, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the\\ncurrent.

The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic\\nfield B is defined as,\\nΦB = BAi  = BA cos θ\\nwhere θ is the angle between B and A.\\n2.

If the circuit is\\nclosed, a current I = ε/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\\ncircuit.\\n3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law\\nindicates this fact.\\n4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\\ninduced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is\\nε = Bl v\\n5. Changing magnetic fields can set up current loops in nearby metal\\n(any conductor) bodies. They dissipate electrical energy as heat. Such\\ncurrents are called eddy currents.\\n6.

It is equal to NΦ/I.\\nMIGRATION OF BIRDS\\nThe migratory pattern of birds is one of the mysteries in the field of biology, and indeed all\\nof science. For example, every winter birds from Siberia fly unerringly to water spots in the\\nIndian subcontinent. There has been a suggestion that electromagnetic induction may\\nprovide a clue to these migratory patterns. The earth’s magnetic field has existed throughout\\nevolutionary history. It would be of great benefit to migratory birds to use this field to\\ndetermine the direction. As far as we know birds contain no ferromagnetic material. So\\nelectromagnetic induction seems to be the only reasonable mechanism to determine\\ndirection. Consider the optimal case where the magnetic field B, the velocity of the bird v,\\nand two relevant points of its anatomy separated by a distance l, all three are mutually\\nperpendicular. From the formula for motional emf, Eq. (6.5),\\nε = Blv\\nTaking B = 4 × 10 –5 T, l = 2 cm wide, and v = 10 m/s, we obtain\\nε  = 4 × 10–5 × 2 × 10–2 × 10 V = 8 × 10 –6 V\\n   = 8 μV\\nThis extremely small potential difference suggests that our hypothesis is of doubtful\\nvalidity.

The main\\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\\nare exploited in many devices of daily use.

In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by\\nusing thick wire.\\n(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents\\nin the iron core and causes heating.

Joule heating\\nis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of\\nalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same\\naverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce\\nunder the same conditions.\\n5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one\\nshould take care of their phases properly.

The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent\\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide\\nus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that\\nwe already know as the law of vector addition.\\n7.

While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law.

This effect is of great\\nimportance because it explains the existence of radio\\nwaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other\\nforms of electromagnetic waves.\\nTo see how a changing electric field gives rise to\\na magnetic field, let us consider the process of\\ncharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital\\nlaw given by (Chapter 4)\\n“B.dl = μ0 i (t)           (8.1)\\nto find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor.\\nFigure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which\\nis a part of circuit through which a time-dependent\\ncurrent i (t) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a\\npoint such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate\\ncapacitor.  For this, we consider a plane circular loop of\\nradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction\\nof the current-carrying wire, and which is centred\\nsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From\\nsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the\\ncircumference of the circular loop and is the same in\\nmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the\\nmagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq.

This\\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such\\nsurfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of\\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not μ0i,\\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\\nhave a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,\\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface\\nis used.\\nWe can actually guess the missing term by looking carefully at\\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\\nplates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\\nelectric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/ε0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\\nis the electric flux ΦE through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is\\nE\\n00\\n1== QQAA AΦ ε ε=E (8.3)\\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq.

If we generalise\\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\\nthe surface, another term which is ε0 times the rate of change of electric\\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P\\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\\ncharges is called conduction current.

In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states\\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise\\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with\\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is\\nFIGURE 8.2 (a) The\\nelectric and magnetic\\nfields E and B between\\nthe capacitor plates, at\\nthe point M.

Neither stationary charges\\nnor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of\\nelectromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while\\nthe latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.\\nIt is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges\\nradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond\\nthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,\\nqualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.\\n(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This\\nproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating\\nmagnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and\\nso on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each\\nother, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space.\\nThe frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the\\nfrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the\\npropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the\\naccelerated charge.\\nFrom the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the\\nprediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all\\nwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate\\nat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not\\npossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 1014 Hz, while the\\nfrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about\\n1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic\\nwave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio wave region), as\\nin the Hertz’s experiment (1887).\\nHertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s theory created a\\nsensation and sparked off other important works in this field.

The electric field Ex is along the x-axis,\\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\\nmagnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again varies\\nsinusoidally with z. The electric and magnetic fields Ex\\nand By are perpendicular to each other, and to the\\ndirection z of propagation.

They differ from all the other waves we have studied\\nso far, in respect that no material medium is involved in the vibrations of\\nthe electric and magnetic fields. Sound waves in air are longitudinal waves\\nof compression and rarefaction. Transverse waves on the surface of water\\nconsist of water moving up and down as the wave spreads horizontally\\nand radially onwards. Transverse elastic (sound) waves can also propagate\\nin a solid, which is rigid and that resists shear. Scientists in the nineteenth\\ncentury were so much used to this mechanical picture that they thought\\nthat there must be some medium pervading all space and all matter,\\nwhich responds to electric and magnetic fields just as any elastic medium\\ndoes. They called this medium ether. They were so convinced of the reality\\nof this medium, that there is even a novel called The Poison Belt by Sir\\nArthur Conan Doyle (the creator of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes)\\nwhere the solar system is supposed to pass through a poisonous region\\nof ether! We now accept that no such physical medium is needed. The\\nfamous experiment of Michelson and Morley in 1887 demolished\\nconclusively the hypothesis of ether. Electric and magnetic fields,\\noscillating in space and time, can sustain each other in vacuum.\\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity ε and a magnetic\\npermeability μ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\\nfrom the external fields). These replace ε0 and μ0 in the description to\\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in\\na material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability μ, the\\nvelocity of light becomes,\\n1v\\nμε\\n= (8.11)\\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of\\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\\nlight in the two media.\\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\\nimportant fundamental constant.

The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.\\nNamely, the metre is now defined as the distance travelled by light in\\nvacuum in a time (1/ c) seconds = (2.99792458 × 10 8)–1 seconds. This\\nhas come about for the following reason. The basic unit of time can be\\ndefined very accurately in terms of some atomic frequency, i.e., frequency\\nof light emitted by an atom in a particular process. The basic unit of length\\nis harder to define as accurately in a direct way. Earlier measurement of c\\nusing earlier units of length (metre rods, etc.) converged to a value of about\\n2.9979246 × 108 m/s. Since c is such a strongly fixed number, unit of\\nlength can be defined in terms of c and the unit of time!\\nHertz not only showed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but\\nalso demonstrated that the waves, which had wavelength ten million times\\nthat of the light waves, could be diffracted, refracted and polarised. Thus,\\nhe conclusively established the wave nature of the radiation. Further, he\\nproduced stationary electromagnetic waves and determined their\\nwavelength by measuring the distance between two successive nodes.\\nSince the frequency of the wave was known (being equal to the frequency\\nof the oscillator), he obtained the speed of the wave using the formula\\nv = νλ and found that the waves travelled with the same speed as the\\nspeed of light.\\nThe fact that electromagnetic waves are polarised can be easily seen\\nin the response of a portable AM radio to a broadcasting station. If an\\nAM radio has a telescopic antenna, it responds to the electric part of the\\nsignal. When the antenna is turned horizontal, the signal will be greatly\\ndiminished. Some portable radios have horizontal antenna (usually inside\\nthe case of radio), which are sensitive to the magnetic component of the\\nelectromagnetic wave. Such a radio must remain horizontal in order to\\nreceive the signal. In such cases, response also depends on the orientation\\nof the radio with respect to the station.\\nDo electromagnetic waves carry energy and momentum like other\\nwaves? Yes, they do. We have seen in chapter 2 that in a region of free\\nspace with electric field E, there is an energy density (ε0E2/2). Similarly,\\nas seen in Chapter 6, associated with a magnetic field B is a magnetic\\nenergy density (B2/2μ0). As electromagnetic wave contains both electric\\nand magnetic fields, there is a non-zero energy density associated with\\nit. Now consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of\\nthe electromagnetic wave (Fig. 8.4). If there are, on this plane, electric\\ncharges, they will be set and sustained in motion by the electric and\\nmagnetic fields of the electromagnetic wave. The charges thus acquire\\nenergy and momentum from the waves. This just illustrates the fact that\\nan electromagnetic wave (like other waves) carries energy and momentum.\\nSince it carries momentum, an electromagnetic wave also exerts pressure,\\ncalled radiation pressure .\\nIf the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is U, it can be shown\\nthat the magnitude of the total momentum delivered to this surface (for\\ncomplete absorption) is,\\nUp c= (8.12)'),\n",

They are used in radio and television communication systems. They\\nare generally in the frequency range from 500 kHz to about 1000 MHz.\\nThe AM (amplitude modulated) band is from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. Higher\\nfrequencies upto 54 MHz are used for short wave bands. TV waves range\\nfrom 54 MHz to 890 MHz. The FM (frequency modulated) radio band\\nextends from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. Cellular phones use radio waves to\\ntransmit voice communication in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. How\\nthese waves are transmitted and received is described in Chapter 15.\\n8.4.2  Microwaves\\nMicrowaves (short-wavelength radio waves), with frequencies in the\\ngigahertz (GHz) range, are produced by special vacuum tubes (called\\nklystrons, magnetrons and Gunn diodes). Due to their short wavelengths,\\nthey are suitable for the radar systems used in aircraft navigation. Radar\\nalso provides the basis for the speed guns used to time fast balls, tennis-\\nserves, and automobiles. Microwave ovens are an interesting domestic\\napplication of these waves. In such ovens, the frequency of the microwaves\\nis selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that\\nenergy from the waves is transferred efficiently to the kinetic energy of\\nthe molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water.\\nMICROWAVE OVEN\\nThe spectrum of electromagnetic radiation contains a part known as microwaves. These\\nwaves have frequency and energy smaller than visible light and wavelength larger than it.\\nWhat is the principle of a microwave oven and how does it work?\\nOur objective is to cook food or warm it up. All food items such as fruit, vegetables,\\nmeat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that\\na certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of\\nthe random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or\\nrotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 300 crore\\nhertz, which is 3 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules\\nabsorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this\\nenergy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.\\nOne should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because\\nof the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt\\nfrom heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large\\nmolecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb\\nmicrowaves. Hence, they do not get heated up.\\nThus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of\\nappropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way\\nenergy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel\\non the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of\\nenergy from the vessel. In the microwave oven, on the other hand, energy is directly  delivered\\nto water molecules which is shared by the entire food.'),\n",

This band\\nlies adjacent to the low-frequency or long-wave length end of the visible\\nspectrum. Infrared waves are sometimes referred to as heat waves. This\\nis because water molecules present in most materials readily absorb\\ninfrared waves (many other molecules, for example, CO2, NH3, also absorb\\ninfrared waves). After absorption, their thermal motion increases, that is,\\nthey heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared lamps are used in\\nphysical therapy. Infrared radiation also plays an important role in\\nmaintaining the earth’s warmth or average temperature through the\\ngreenhouse effect. Incoming visible light (which passes relatively easily\\nthrough the atmosphere) is absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-\\nradiated as infrared (longer wavelength) radiations. This radiation is\\ntrapped by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour.\\nInfrared detectors are used in Earth satellites, both for military purposes\\nand to observe growth of crops. Electronic devices (for example\\nsemiconductor light emitting diodes) also   emit infrared and are widely\\nused in the remote switches of household electronic systems such as TV\\nsets, video recorders and hi-fi systems.\\n8.4.4 Visible rays\\nIt is the most familiar form of electromagnetic waves. It is the part of the\\nspectrum that is detected by the human eye. It runs from about\\n4 × 1014 Hz to about 7 × 1014\\n Hz or a wavelength range of about 700 –\\n400 nm. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides\\nus information about the world. Our eyes are sensitive to this range of\\nwavelengths. Different animals are sensitive to different range of\\nwavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves, and the\\n‘visible’ range of many insects extends well into the utraviolet.\\n8.4.5 Ultraviolet rays\\nIt covers wavelengths ranging from about 4 × 10–7 m (400 nm) down to\\n6 × 10–10m (0.6 nm). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is produced by special\\nlamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet\\nlight. But fortunately, most of it is absorbed in the ozone layer in the\\natmosphere at an altitude of about 40 – 50 km. UV light in large quantities\\nhas harmful effects on humans.

Maxwell found an inconsistency in the Ampere’s law and suggested the\\nexistence of an additional current, called displacement current, to remove\\nthis inconsistency. This displacement current is due to time-varying electric\\nfield and is given by\\n0\\nd\\nd\\ndi t\\nΦε Ε=\\nand acts as a source of magnetic field in exactly the same way as conduction\\ncurrent.\\n2. An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge\\noscillating harmonically with frequency ν, produces electromagnetic waves\\nof the same frequency ν. An electric dipole is a basic source of\\nelectromagnetic waves.\\n3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were\\nfirst produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus\\nverified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.\\n4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an\\nelectromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and\\nB are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of\\nthe electromagnetic wave. For a wave of frequency ν, wavelength λ,\\npropagating along z-direction, we have\\nE  = Ex (t) = E0 sin (kz – ω t )\\n   = E0 sin    02s in 2zz ttE Tνλλ\\n⎡⎤ ⎡⎤⎛⎞ ⎛⎞π− = π−⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎢⎥ ⎢⎥⎝⎠ ⎝⎠⎣⎦ ⎣⎦\\nB = By(t) = B0 sin (kz – ω t)\\n   = 00sin 2 sin 2zz tBt B Tνλλ\\n⎡⎤ ⎡⎤⎛⎞ ⎛⎞π− = π−⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎢⎥ ⎢⎥⎝⎠ ⎝⎠⎣⎦ ⎣⎦\\nThey are related by E0/B0 = c.\\n5. The speed c of electromagnetic wave in vacuum is related to μ0 and ε0 (the\\nfree space permeability and permittivity constants) as follows:\\n001/c μ ε= . The value of c equals the speed of light obtained from\\noptical measurements.\\nLight is an electromagnetic wave; c is, therefore, also the speed of light.\\nElectromagnetic waves other than light also have the same velocity c in\\nfree space.\\nThe speed of light, or of electromagnetic waves in a material medium is\\ngiven by 1/v με=\\nwhere μ is the permeability of the medium and ε its permittivity.\\n6. Electromagnetic waves carry energy as they travel through space and this\\nenergy is shared equally by the electric and magnetic fields.\\nElectromagnetic waves transport momentum as well. When these waves\\nstrike a surface, a pressure is exerted on the surface. If total energy\\ntransferred to a surface in time t is U, total momentum delivered to this\\nsurface is p = U/c.\\n7.

The detailed interaction and\\nso the mechanism of absorption, scattering, etc., depend on the wavelength\\nof the electromagnetic wave, and the nature of the atoms and molecules\\nin the medium.\\nPOINTS TO PONDER\\n1. The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves\\nlies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through\\nvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ\\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter.\\n2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\\nhaving wavelength of 10 –14 m to 10 –15 m, typically originate from an\\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\\n3. The oscillating fields of an electromagnetic wave can accelerate charges\\nand can produce oscillating currents. Therefore, an apparatus designed\\nto detect electromagnetic waves is based on this fact. Hertz original\\n‘receiver’ worked in exactly this way. The same basic principle is utilised\\nin practically all modern receiving devices. High frequency\\nelectromagnetic waves are detected by other means based on the\\nphysical effects they produce on interacting with matter.\\n4. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light,\\nvibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules of a\\nsubstance. This vibration increases the internal energy and\\nconsequently, the temperature of the substance. This is why infrared\\nwaves are often called heat waves.\\n5. The centre of sensitivity of our eyes coincides with the centre of the\\nwavelength distribution of the sun. It is because humans have evolved\\nwith visions most sensitive to the strongest wavelengths from\\nthe sun.\\nEXERCISES\\n8.1 Figure 8.6 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of\\nradius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm.

For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\\nWRP =   \\nP\\nR\\ndext∫ Fr /G67\\n        =    \\nP\\nR\\ndE− ∫ Fr/G67  (2.1)\\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\\nas potential energy.\\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\\nR and P.\\nThus, potential energy difference\\nPR R PUU U W∆= − = (2.2)\\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –WRP .)\\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving')"

Have\\nyou ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another\\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\\nsky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric\\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the\\nstudy of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges .\\n1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE\\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\\nelektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\\nChapter One\\nELECTRIC CHARGES\\nAND FIELDS',\n",

Take them near a\\nTV screen or computer monitor. You will\\nsee that the strips get attracted to the\\nscreen. In fact they remain stuck to the\\nscreen for a while.\\nIt was observed that if two glass rods\\nrubbed with wool or silk cloth are\\nbrought close to each other, they repel\\neach other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands\\nof wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with\\nwhich the rods were rubbed, also repel\\neach other. However, the glass rod and\\nwool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s\\nfur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other\\nhand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk\\nor wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.\\nIf a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls\\n(now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon\\nthread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled\\nby the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a\\nglass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a\\npith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with\\nplastic rod [Fig. 1.1(f )].\\nThese seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts\\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\\nan entity which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\\nan electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested\\nthat there are two kinds of electrification and we find  that (i) like charges',\n",

The experiments also\\ndemonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith\\nballs on  contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged\\nby  contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is\\ncalled the polarity of charge.\\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\\nno longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light\\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\\nFIGURE 1.1 Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and\\nunlike charges attract each other.Interactive animation on simple electrostatic experiments:\\nhttp://ephysics.physics.ucla.edu/travoltage/HTML/',\n",

Therefore the charges were named\\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\\nWe know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of\\nthe same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the\\nphilosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention,\\nthe charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic\\nrod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it\\nis said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be\\nneutral.\\nUNIFICATION OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\\nIn olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity\\ndealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism\\ndescribed interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish\\nscientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current\\nthrough a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation\\nby saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets\\ngenerate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell\\nand the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the\\ninterdependence of these two subjects. This field is called electromagnetism. Most of the\\nphenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually\\nevery force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the\\nmatter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living\\norganisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the\\nfundamental forces of nature.\\nMaxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism\\nas Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics.

He claimed that the science of optics is intimately\\nrelated to that of electricity and magnetism.\\nThe science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological\\ncivilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety\\nof the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science.\\nAlthough charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the\\nframe of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You\\nknow that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance\\nbetween the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as\\nthe square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter\\nthat electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force\\nby several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).\\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\\nthe amount of charge.',\n",

Make a hole in the cork\\nsufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly.

The separation\\nis a rough measure of the amount of charge on the\\nelectroscope.\\nTo understand how the electroscope works, use\\nthe white paper strips we used for seeing the\\nattraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half\\nso that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and\\niron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown\\nin Fig. 1.3. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold.\\nYou would notice that the two halves move apart.\\nThis shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold\\nit into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each\\nother. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the\\ncurtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is\\ntransferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the\\nhalves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The\\ndivergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them.

It is therefore  essential that we\\nlearn more about such a force.\\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\\nlosing some of its electrons.

Thus the rod gets\\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\\nmaterial body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material\\nbody can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when\\na body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why\\nwe have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing\\nthe bodies.\\n1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\\nA metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of\\nbeing charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is\\nrubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging.\\nSuppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and\\nthe other end to a negatively charged plastic rod.

If a similar experiment is repeated\\nwith a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take\\nplace from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge\\nnot take place from the rod to the ball?\\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them,\\nothers do not.

The charges on metal leak through our body to the\\nground as both are conductors of electricity.\\n  When we bring a charged body  in contact with the earth,  all the\\nexcess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current\\nto pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our\\nbody). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called\\ngrounding or earthing. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical\\ncircuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth\\nand thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are  used in buildings\\nfor the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.

Thus the pith ball is charged by contact. It is then repelled\\nby the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely\\ncharged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is  a  question\\nwe have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be\\nhappening by performing the following experiment.\\n(i) Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands,\\nin contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a).\\n(ii) Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking\\ncare that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres\\nare attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge\\non the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in\\nthe metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the\\nsurfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an\\nexcess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an\\nexcess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres\\nhave accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge\\nstarts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled\\nby these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of\\nforce of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the',\n",

In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of\\nforce of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the\\naccumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation.\\nThe process is called induction of charge  and happens almost\\ninstantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown,\\ntill the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the\\ncharges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to\\ntheir original neutral state.\\n(iii) Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still\\nheld near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found\\nto be oppositely charged and attract each other.\\n(iv) Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as\\nshown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The\\ncharges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in\\nFig. 1.4(e).\\nIn this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely\\ncharged. This is charging by induction. The positively charged glass rod\\ndoes not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by\\ncontact.\\nWhen electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect\\ntakes place.

Here,  we shall now\\ndescribe some other properties of the electric charge.\\nIf the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the\\ndistances between them, we treat them as point charges . All the\\ncharge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point\\nin space.\\n1.5.1  Additivity of charges\\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall\\nfollow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can\\nbe done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q1 and q2,\\nthe total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically\\nq1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like\\nthe mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1, q2, q3, …, q n, then\\nthe total charge of the system is q1 + q 2 + q 3 + … + q n .  Charge has\\nmagnitude but no direction, similar to the mass. However, there is one\\ndifference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive\\nwhereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to\\nbe used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the\\ntotal charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5,\\nin some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the\\nsame unit.\\n1.5.2  Charge is conserved\\nWe have already  hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by\\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\\ncharges are either created or destroyed.

By convention, the charge\\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.\\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\\nMillikan in 1912.\\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\\nsubsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge\\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 2\\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\\nbasic unit of charge is\\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\\nThus, there are about 6 × 10 18 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\\nand hence we use smaller units 1 μC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe,\\nall the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a\\nbody contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount of charge\\non the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2 are integers,\\ntheir difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always\\nan integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps\\nof e.\\nThe step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few μC.

The grainy\\nnature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge\\ndistribution.\\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e.

At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\\nvalues.

Therefore\\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10 –10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\\n3600) years = 198 years.

The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\\n(= 6.02 × 10 23 molecules) of water is 18 g.

Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\\nand conservation.\\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body\\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,\\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored.\\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\\nof all individual charges in the system.\\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\\nfrom one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.\\n5.

              " '2.1  INTRODUCTION\\nIn Chapters 6 and 8 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was\\nintroduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a\\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\\nconservative forces.\\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges, like the gravitational\\nforce, is also a conservative force. This is not surprising, since both have\\ninverse-square dependence on distance and differ mainly in the\\nproportionality constants – the masses in the gravitational law are\\nreplaced by charges in Coulomb’s law. Thus, like the potential energy of\\na mass in a gravitational field, we can define electrostatic potential energy\\nof a charge in an electrostatic field.\\nConsider an electrostatic field E due to some charge configuration.\\nFirst, for simplicity, consider the field E due to a charge Q placed at the\\norigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a\\npoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference\\nChapter Two\\nELECTROSTATIC\\nPOTENTIAL AND\\nCAPACITANCE',\n",

First, we assume\\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\\nWRP =   \\nP\\nR\\ndext∫ Fr /G67\\n        =    \\nP\\nR\\ndE− ∫ Fr/G67  (2.1)\\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\\nas potential energy.\\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\\nR and P.\\nThus, potential energy difference\\nPR R PUU U W∆= − = (2.2)\\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –WRP .)\\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving',\n",

It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\\none point to the other.

Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\\nconductor .\\n2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\\nsurface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every\\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\\n3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\\nthe static situation\\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\\nin every small volume or surface element.

Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\\nits surface\\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface.

In contrast to conductors,\\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\\neffect, we need to look at the charge\\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\\nmolecular level.\\nThe molecules of a substance may be\\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\\nmoment.

Such currents occur\\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents.\\n3.2  ELECTRIC CURRENT\\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q+ be the net amount (i.e.,\\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q– be the net amount of negative\\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\\ninterval t, then, is q = q+– q–. This is proportional to t for steady current\\nChapter Three\\nCURRENT\\nELECTRICITY',\n",

Let ∆ Q be the net charge flowing across a cross-\\nsection of a conductor during the time interval ∆ t [i.e., between times t\\nand (t + ∆ t)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of ∆ Q to ∆ t in the limit of ∆ t\\ntending to zero,\\n( )\\n0\\nlim\\nt\\nQIt t∆→\\n∆≡ ∆ (3.2)\\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere.

Hence in the\\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\\ncurrent thereafter.\\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time.

              " '4.1  INTRODUCTION\\nBoth Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000\\nyears. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\\nrealised that they were intimately related*. During a lecture demonstration\\nin the summer of 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted\\nnoticed that a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in\\na nearby magnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon.\\nHe found that the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary\\ncircle which has the straight wire as its centre and has its plane\\nperpendicular to the wire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is\\nnoticeable when the current is large and the needle sufficiently close to\\nthe wire so that the earth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the\\ndirection of the current reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)].\\nThe deflection increases on increasing the current or bringing the needle\\ncloser to the wire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange\\nthemselves in concentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)].\\nOersted concluded that moving charges or currents produced a\\nmagnetic field in the surrounding space .\\nFollowing this there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\\nChapter Four\\nMOVING CHARGES\\nAND MAGNETISM\\n* See the box in Chapter 1, Page 3.',\n",

Vast, distant galaxies, the\\ntiny invisible atoms, men and beasts all are permeated through and\\nthrough with a host of magnetic fields from a variety of sources. The earth’s\\nmagnetism predates human evolution. The word magnet is derived from\\nthe name of an island in Greece called magnesia where magnetic ore\\ndeposits were found, as early as 600 BC. Shepherds on this island\\ncomplained that their wooden shoes (which had nails) at times stayed\\nstruck to the ground. Their iron-tipped rods were similarly affected. This\\nattractive property of magnets made it difficult for them to move around.\\nThe directional property of magnets was also known since ancient\\ntimes. A thin long piece of a magnet, when suspended freely, pointed in\\nthe north-south direction. A similar effect was observed when it was placed\\non a piece of cork which was then allowed to float in still water. The name\\nlodestone (or loadstone) given to a naturally occurring ore of iron-\\nmagnetite means leading stone. The technological exploitation of this\\nproperty is generally credited to the Chinese. Chinese texts dating 400\\nBC mention the use of magnetic needles for navigation on ships. Caravans\\ncrossing the Gobi desert also employed magnetic needles.\\nA Chinese legend narrates the tale of the victory of the emperor Huang-ti\\nabout four thousand years ago, which he owed to his craftsmen (whom\\nChapter Five\\nMAGNETISM AND\\nMATTER',\n",

When the\\ncompass is held level, it points along the direction of the horizontal component of the earth’s\\nmagnetic field at the location. Thus, the compass needle would stay along the magnetic\\nmeridian of the place. In some places on the earth there are deposits of magnetic minerals\\nwhich cause the compass needle to deviate from the magnetic meridian. Knowing the magnetic\\ndeclination at a place allows us to correct the compass to determine the direction of true\\nnorth.\\nSo what happens if we take our compass to the magnetic pole? At the poles, the magnetic\\nfield lines are converging or diverging vertically so that the horizontal component is negligible.\\nIf the needle is only capable of moving in a horizontal plane, it can point along any direction,\\nrendering it useless as a direction finder. What one needs in such a case is a dip needle\\nwhich is a compass pivoted to move in a vertical plane containing the magnetic field of the\\nearth. The needle of the compass then shows the angle which the magnetic field makes with\\nthe vertical. At the magnetic poles such a needle will point straight down.\\nExample 5.9 In the magnetic meridian of a certain place, the\\nhorizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field is 0.26G and the\\ndip angle is 60º.

It has been known since ancient times\\nthat magnetic materials tend to point in the north-south direction; like\\nmagnetic poles repel and unlike ones attract; and cutting a bar magnet\\nin two leads to two smaller magnets. Magnetic poles cannot be isolated.\\n2. When a bar magnet of dipole moment m is placed in a uniform magnetic\\nfield B,\\n     (a) the force on it is zero,\\n     (b) the torque on it is m × B,\\n     (c) its potential energy is –m.B, where we choose the zero of energy at\\nthe orientation when m is perpendicular to B.\\n3.

The earth’s magnetic field resembles that of a (hypothetical) magnetic\\ndipole located at the centre of the earth.

Similarly, the\\npole near the geographic south pole is called the south magnetic pole.\\nThis dipole is aligned making a small angle with the rotation axis of\\nthe earth.

But technological\\nexploitation of the directional properties of magnets predates this scientific\\nunderstanding by two thousand years. Thus, scientific understanding is\\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\\ntandem.\\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\\nelectronic charge with value | e| = 1.6 ×10 –19 C. All other charges are\\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\\nelectric charge is quantised.\\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\\n4. The earth’s magnetic field is not due to a huge bar magnet inside it. The\\nearth’s core is hot and molten. Perhaps convective currents in this core\\nare responsible for the earth’s magnetic field. As to what ‘dynamo’ effect\\nsustains this current, and why the earth’s field reverses polarity every\\nmillion years or so, we do not know.\\n5. A miniscule difference in the value of χ , the magnetic susceptibility, yields\\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic. For\\ndiamagnetic materials χ  = – 10–5 whereas χ  = +10 –5 for paramagnetic\\nmaterials.\\n6. There exists a perfect diamagnet , namely, a superconductor. This is a\\nmetal at very low temperatures.

In this case χ  = –1, µ r = 0, µ  = 0. The\\nexternal magnetic field is totally expelled. Interestingly, this material is\\nalso a perfect conductor. However, there exists no classical theory which\\nties these two properties together. A quantum-mechanical theory by\\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS theory) explains these effects. The\\nBCS theory was proposed in1957 and was eventually recognised by a Nobel\\nPrize in physics in 1970.\\n7. The phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is reminiscent of similar\\nbehaviour concerning the elastic properties of materials. Strain\\nmay not be proportional to stress; here H and B (or M) are not\\nlinearly related. The stress-strain curve exhibits hysteresis and\\narea enclosed by it represents the energy dissipated per unit volume.\\nA similar interpretation can be given to the B-H magnetic hysteresis\\ncurve.\\n8. Diamagnetism is universal. It is present in all materials. But it\\nis weak and hard to detect if the substance is para- or ferromagnetic.\\n9. We have classified materials as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and\\nferromagnetic.

Experimental observations\\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C 1 in\\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards\\nor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\\nflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces\\nemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric\\ncurrent to flow in coil C 1 and through the galvanometer. A\\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant.

The statement of the law is:\\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b).

              " '7.1  INTRODUCTION\\nWe have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc\\nsources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages\\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and\\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.\\nThis is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main\\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\\nare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we\\ntune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special\\nproperty of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter.\\nChapter Seven\\nALTERNATING\\nCURRENT\\n* The phrases ac voltage  and ac current  are contradictory and redundant,\\nrespectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating\\ncurrent current . Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity\\ndisplaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted\\nthat we follow others in its use.

While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the\\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities.

All food items such as fruit, vegetables,\\nmeat, cereals, etc., contain water as a constituent. Now, what does it mean when we say that\\na certain object has become warmer? When the temperature of a body rises, the energy of\\nthe random motion of atoms and molecules increases and the molecules travel or vibrate or\\nrotate with higher energies. The frequency of rotation of water molecules is about 300 crore\\nhertz, which is 3 gigahertz (GHz). If water receives microwaves of this frequency, its molecules\\nabsorb this radiation, which is equivalent to heating up water. These molecules share this\\nenergy with neighbouring food molecules, heating up the food.\\nOne should use porcelain vessels and not metal containers in a microwave oven because\\nof the danger of getting a shock from accumulated electric charges. Metals may also melt\\nfrom heating. The porcelain container remains unaffected and cool, because its large\\nmolecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies, and thus cannot absorb\\nmicrowaves. Hence, they do not get heated up.\\nThus, the basic principle of a microwave oven is to generate microwave radiation of\\nappropriate frequency in the working space of the oven where we keep food. This way\\nenergy is not wasted in heating up the vessel. In the conventional heating method, the vessel\\non the burner gets heated first, and then the food inside gets heated because of transfer of\\nenergy from the vessel.

An accelerating charge produces electromagnetic waves. An electric charge\\noscillating harmonically with frequency ν, produces electromagnetic waves\\nof the same frequency ν. An electric dipole is a basic source of\\nelectromagnetic waves.\\n3. Electromagnetic waves with wavelength of the order of a few metres were\\nfirst produced and detected in the laboratory by Hertz in 1887. He thus\\nverified a basic prediction of Maxwell’s equations.\\n4. Electric and magnetic fields oscillate sinusoidally in space and time in an\\nelectromagnetic wave. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields, E and\\nB are perpendicular to each other, and to the direction of propagation of\\nthe electromagnetic wave.

The basic difference between various types of electromagnetic waves\\nlies in their wavelengths or frequencies since all of them travel through\\nvacuum with the same speed. Consequently, the waves differ\\nconsiderably in their mode of interaction with matter.\\n2. Accelerated charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves. The\\nwavelength of the electromagnetic wave is often correlated with the\\ncharacteristic size of the system that radiates. Thus, gamma radiation,\\nhaving wavelength of 10 –14 m to 10 –15 m, typically originate from an\\natomic nucleus. X-rays are emitted from heavy atoms. Radio waves\\nare produced by accelerating electrons in a circuit. A transmitting\\nantenna can most efficiently radiate waves having a wavelength of\\nabout the same size as the antenna. Visible radiation emitted by atoms\\nis, however, much longer in wavelength than atomic size.\\n3.
